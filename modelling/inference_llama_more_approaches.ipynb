    "# Llama 2 inference with Q-lora more approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLaMA 2** represents the next generation of their Large Language Model (LLM). This model was trained on a staggering 2 trillion tokens over six months.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore multiple approaches to tackle the challenges presented by the Kaggle competition. To leverage the full potential of LLaMA 2 while maintaining efficiency, we implement **QLoRA**, an innovative fine-tuning method that quantizes the model to just 4 bits and incorporates Low-Rank Adapters. This cutting-edge technique not only reduces the resource demands of fine-tuning but also allows for effective adjustments using a single GPU, making it accessible for various applications. By experimenting with different strategies, we aim to enhance the performance of LLaMA 2 in the context of the competition's requirements."
