Viruses are microscopic infectious agents composed of genetic material enclosed in a protein coat, requiring
a host cell to replicate. Protozoa, on the other hand, are single-celled eukaryotic microorganisms found in 
aquatic environments, with some being parasitic and causing diseases. Cells, as the fundamental units of life, 
possess a cell membrane, genetic material, and the ability to perform essential life processes. Gymnosperms, a 
group of seed-producing plants, produce ""naked seeds"" on cones and include species like pine trees and cycads.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

Many of these systems evolve in a self-similar fashion in the sense that data obtained from the snapshot at any fixed time is similar to the respective data taken from the snapshot of any earlier or later time. Many other seemingly disparate systems which are found to exhibit dynamic scaling. The form of their proposal for dynamic scaling was: :f(x,t)\sim t^{-w}x^{-\tau} \varphi \left( \frac x {t^z} \right), where the exponents satisfy the following relation: :w=(2-\tau)z. == Test for dynamic scaling == In such systems we can define a certain time-dependent stochastic variable x. Dynamic scaling (sometimes known as Family-Vicsek scaling) is a litmus test that shows whether an evolving system exhibits self-similarity. Self-similar processes are types of stochastic processes that exhibit the phenomenon of self-similarity. Essentially such systems can be termed as temporal self-similarity since the same system is similar at different times. == Examples == Many phenomena investigated by physicists are not static but evolve probabilistically with time (i.e. Stochastic process).

The flag of Sicily (; ) shows a triskeles symbol (a figure of three legs arranged in rotational symmetry), and at its center a Gorgoneion (depiction of the head of Medusa) and a pair of wings and three wheat ears. ==Description== The flag is characterized by the presence of the triskeles in its middle, the (winged) head of Medusa and three wheat ears, representing the extreme fertility of the land of Sicily,Radicini, Ninni. The triskelion symbol is said to represent the three capes (headlands or promontories of the island of Sicily), namely: Pelorus (Peloro, Tip of Faro, Messina: North-East); Pachynus (Passero, Syracuse: South); and Lilybæum (Lilibeo, Cape Boeo, Marsala: West), which form three points of a triangle from the historical three valli of the island.Radicini, Ninni. An early flag of Sicily, proposed in 1848, included the Sicilian triskeles or ""Trinacria symbol"".

<<Question:>>
Which of the following statements accurately describes the origin and significance of the triskeles symbol?

<<Options:>>
A, The triskeles symbol was reconstructed as a feminine divine triad by the rulers of Syracuse, and later adopted as an emblem. Its usage may also be related to the Greek name of Sicily, Trinacria, which means ""having three headlands."" The head of Medusa at the center of the Sicilian triskeles represents the three headlands.
B, The triskeles symbol is a representation of three interlinked spirals, which was adopted as an emblem by the rulers of Syracuse. Its usage in modern flags of Sicily has its origins in the ancient Greek name for the island, Trinacria, which means ""Sicily with three corners."" The head of Medusa at the center is a representation of the island's rich cultural heritage.
C, The triskeles symbol is a representation of a triple goddess, reconstructed by the rulers of Syracuse, who adopted it as an emblem. Its significance lies in the fact that it represents the Greek name for Sicily, Trinacria, which contains the element ""tria,"" meaning three. The head of Medusa at the center of the Sicilian triskeles represents the three headlands.
D, The triskeles symbol represents three interlocked spiral arms, which became an emblem for the rulers of Syracuse. Its usage in modern flags of Sicily is due to the island's rich cultural heritage, which dates back to ancient times. The head of Medusa at the center represents the lasting influence of Greek mythology on Sicilian culture.
E, The triskeles symbol is a representation of the Greek goddess Hecate, reconstructed by the rulers of Syracuse. Its adoption as an emblem was due to its cultural significance, as it represented the ancient Greek name for Sicily, Trinacria. The head of Medusa at the center of the Sicilian triskeles represents the island's central location in the Mediterranean.

Renormalization is distinct from regularization, another technique to control infinities by assuming the existence of new unknown physics at new scales. == Self-interactions in classical physics == thumbnail|upright=1.3|Figure 1. Regularization is the first step towards obtaining a completely finite and meaningful result; in quantum field theory it must be usually followed by a related, but independent technique called renormalization. Rather than the existence of unknown new physics, assuming the existence of particle interactions with other surrounding particles in the environment, renormalization offers an alternatively strategy to resolve infinities in such classical problems. ==Specific types== Specific types of regularization procedures include *Dimensional regularization *Pauli–Villars regularization *Lattice regularization *Zeta function regularization *Causal regularizationScharf, G.: Finite Quantum Electrodynamics: The Causal Approach, Springer 1995. In physics, especially quantum field theory, regularization is a method of modifying observables which have singularities in order to make them finite by the introduction of a suitable parameter called the regulator. Similar regularization arguments work in other renormalization problems. By contrast, any present regularization method introduces formal coefficients that must eventually be disposed of by renormalization. ===Opinions=== Paul Dirac was persistently, extremely critical about procedures of renormalization. 

<<Question:>>
What is the significance of regularization in terms of renormalization problems in physics?

<<Options:>>
A, Regularizing the mass-energy of an electron with a finite radius can theoretically simplify calculations involving infinities or singularities, thereby providing explanations that would otherwise be impossible to achieve.
B, Regularizing the mass-energy of an electron with an infinite radius allows for the breakdown of a theory that is valid under one set of conditions. This approach can be applied to other renormalization problems as well.
C, Regularizing the mass-energy of an electron with a finite radius is a means of demonstrating that a system below a certain size can be explained without the need for further calculations. This approach can be applied to other renormalization problems as well.
D, Regularizing the mass-energy of an electron with an infinite radius can be used to provide a highly accurate description of a system under specific conditions. This approach can be transferred to other renormalization problems as well.
E, Regularizing the mass-energy of an electron with an infinite radius is essential for explaining how a system below a certain size operates. This approach can be applied to other renormalization problems as well.

For a closed Gaussian surface, electric flux is given by: where * is the electric field, * is any closed surface, * is the total electric charge inside the surface , * is the electric constant (a universal constant, also called the ""permittivity of free space"") () This relation is known as Gauss' law for electric fields in its integral form and it is one of Maxwell's equations. Under these circumstances, Gauss's law modifies to \Phi_E = \frac{Q_\mathrm{free}}{\varepsilon} for the integral form, and abla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_\mathrm{free}}{\varepsilon} for the differential form. ==Interpretations== ===In terms of fields of force=== Gauss's theorem can be interpreted in terms of the lines of force of the field as follows: The flux through a closed surface is dependent upon both the magnitude and direction of the electric field lines penetrating the surface. See the article Gaussian surface for examples where these symmetries are exploited to compute electric fields. ===Differential form=== By the divergence theorem, Gauss's law can alternatively be written in the differential form: abla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r} where is the divergence of the electric field, is the vacuum permittivity, \varepsilon_r is the relative permittivity, and is the volume charge density (charge per unit volume). ===Equivalence of integral and differential forms=== The integral and differential forms are mathematically equivalent, by the divergence theorem. While Gauss's law holds for all situations, it is most useful for ""by hand"" calculations when high degrees of symmetry exist in the electric field. Two forms of electric flux are used, one for the E-field: : and one for the D-field (called the electric displacement): : This quantity arises in Gauss's law – which states that the flux of the electric field E out of a closed surface is proportional to the electric charge QA enclosed in the surface (independent of how that charge is distributed), the integral form is: : where ε0 is the permittivity of free space. Gauss's law may be expressed as: \Phi_E = \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0} where is the electric flux through a closed surface enclosing any volume , is the total charge enclosed within , and is the electric constant. 

<<Question:>>
Which of the following statements accurately depicts the relationship between Gauss's law, electric flux, electric field, and symmetry in electric fields?

<<Options:>>
A, Gauss's law holds only for situations involving symmetric electric fields, like those with spherical or cylindrical symmetry, and doesn't apply to other field types. Electric flux, as an expression of the total electric field passing through a closed surface, is influenced only by charges within the surface and unaffected by distant charges located outside it. The scalar quantity electric flux is strictly measured in SI fundamental quantities as kg·m3·s−3·A.
B, Gauss's law holds in all cases, but it is most useful for calculations involving symmetric electric fields, like those with spherical or cylindrical symmetry, as they allow for simpler algebraic manipulations. Electric flux is not affected by distant charges outside the closed surface, whereas the net electric field, E, can be influenced by any charges positioned outside of the closed surface. In SI base units, the electric flux is expressed as kg·m3·s−3·A−1.
C, Gauss's law, which applies equally to all electric fields, is typically most useful when dealing with symmetric field configurations, like those with spherical or cylindrical symmetry, since it makes it easier to calculate the total electric flux. Electric flux, an expression of the total electric field through a closed surface, is unaffected by charges outside the surface, while net electric field, E, may be influenced by charges located outside the closed surface. Electric flux is expressed in SI base units as kg·m3·s−1·C.
D, Gauss's law only holds for electric fields with cylindrical symmetry, like those of a straight long wire; it is not applicable to fields with other types of symmetry. Electric flux, which measures the total electric field across a closed surface, is influenced by all charges within the surface as well as by those located outside it. The unit of electric flux in SI base units is kg·m2·s−2·A−1.
E, Gauss's law, which holds for all situations, is most beneficial when applied to electric fields that exhibit higher degrees of symmetry, like those with cylindrical and spherical symmetry. While electric flux is unaffected by charges outside of a given closed surface, the net electric field, E, may be affected by them. The unit of electric flux in SI base units is kg·m2·s−1·C.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

The definition of dimension of cells and of complexes is in the general case different from that of simplicial complexes (see below). It was demonstrated that the dimension of a cell c of an abstract cell complex is equal to the length (number of cells minus 1) of the maximum bounding path leading from any cell of the complex to the cell c. Thus, it is 0 for sets describing points (0-dimensional sets); 1 for sets describing lines (1-dimensional sets having length only); 2 for sets describing surfaces (2-dimensional sets having length and width); and 3 for sets describing volumes (3-dimensional sets having length, width, and height). In mathematics, metric dimension may refer to: * Metric dimension (graph theory), the minimum number of vertices of an undirected graph G in a subset S of G such that all other vertices are uniquely determined by their distances to the vertices in S * Minkowski–Bouligand dimension (also called the metric dimension), a way of determining the dimension of a fractal set in a Euclidean space by counting the number of fixed-size boxes needed to cover the set as a function of the box size * Equilateral dimension of a metric space (also called the metric dimension), the maximum number of points at equal distances from each other * Hausdorff dimension, an extended non-negative real number associated with any metric space that generalizes the notion of the dimension of a real vector space Hausdorff dimension generalizes the well-known integer dimensions assigned to points, lines, planes, etc. by allowing one to distinguish between objects of intermediate size between these integer-dimensional objects. For example, it takes two dimensions to immerse K_3 (an equilateral triangle), and three to immerse K_4 (a regular tetrahedron) as shown to the right. :\dim K_n = n-1 In other words, the dimension of the complete graph is the same as that of the simplex having the same number of vertices. thumb|170px|The complete bipartite graph K_{4,2} drawn in Euclidean 3-space. === Complete bipartite graphs === All star graphs K_{m,1}, for m \ge 3, have dimension 2, as shown in the figure to the left.

The temperature at or above which an antiferromagnetic layer loses its ability to ""pin"" the magnetization direction of an adjacent ferromagnetic layer is called the blocking temperature of that layer and is usually lower than the Néel temperature. ==Geometric frustration== Unlike ferromagnetism, anti-ferromagnetic interactions can lead to multiple optimal states (ground states—states of minimal energy). The magnetic susceptibility of an antiferromagnetic material typically shows a maximum at the Néel temperature. Above the Néel temperature, the material is typically paramagnetic. == Measurement == When no external field is applied, the antiferromagnetic structure corresponds to a vanishing total magnetization. In most well-studied ferromagnet/antiferromagnet bilayers, the Curie temperature of the ferromagnet is larger than the Néel temperature TN of the antiferromagnet. When it reaches the free layer the majority spins relax into lower-energy states of opposite spin, applying a torque to the free layer in the process.thumb|300px|right|A schematic diagram of a spin valve/magnetic tunnel junction.

C, The blocking temperature of an antiferromagnetic layer in a spin valve is the temperature at which the ferromagnetic layer becomes completely demagnetized. The blocking temperature is typically higher than the Néel temperature.
D, The blocking temperature of an antiferromagnetic layer in a spin valve is the temperature at or above which the layer ceases to prevent the orientation of an adjacent ferromagnetic layer. The blocking temperature is typically lower than the Néel temperature.
E, The blocking temperature of an antiferromagnetic layer in a spin valve is the temperature at which the ferromagnetic layer loses its ability to ""pin"" the magnetization direction of an adjacent antiferromagnetic layer. The blocking temperature is typically higher than the Néel temperature.

While such phenomena are sometimes referred to as ""redshifts"" and ""blueshifts"", in astrophysics light-matter interactions that result in energy shifts in the radiation field are generally referred to as ""reddening"" rather than ""redshifting"" which, as a term, is normally reserved for the effects discussed above. In physics, a redshift is an increase in the wavelength, and corresponding decrease in the frequency and photon energy, of electromagnetic radiation (such as light). The opposite change, a decrease in wavelength and simultaneous increase in frequency and energy, is known as a negative redshift, or blueshift. This loss of energy corresponds to a decrease in the wave frequency and increase in the wavelength, known more generally as a redshift. For example, Doppler effect blueshifts () are associated with objects approaching (moving closer to) the observer with the light shifting to greater energies. Redshift is a shift in the spectrum of the emitted electromagnetic radiation from an object toward lower energies and frequencies, associated with the phenomenon of the Doppler effect.

A formal system is an abstract structure used for inferring theorems from axioms according to a set of rules. The explication of the particular axioms used in a theory can help to clarify a suitable level of abstraction that the mathematician would like to work with. A formal theory is an axiomatic system (usually formulated within model theory) that describes a set of sentences that is closed under logical implication. These rules, which are used for carrying out the inference of theorems from axioms, are the logical calculus of the formal system. In general, a formal system is a deductive apparatus that consists of a particular set of axioms along with rules of symbolic manipulation (or rules of inference) that allow for the derivation of new theorems from the axioms. In the most common versions of the notion of formal proof, there are, in addition to the axiom schemes of propositional calculus (or the understanding that all tautologies of propositional calculus are to be taken as axiom schemes in their own right), quantifier axioms, and in addition to modus ponens, one additional rule of inference, known as the rule of generalization: ""From K, infer ∀vK."" 

<<Question:>>
What is the role of axioms in a formal theory?

<<Options:>>
A, Basis statements called axioms form the foundation of a formal theory and, together with the deducing rules, help in deriving a set of statements called theorems using proof theory.
B, Axioms are supplementary statements added to a formal theory that break down otherwise complex statements into more simple ones.
C, Axioms are redundant statements that can be derived from other statements in a formal theory, providing additional perspective to theorems derived from the theory.
D, The axioms in a theory are used for experimental validation of the theorems derived from the statements in the theory.
E, The axioms in a formal theory are added to prove that the statements derived from the theory are true, irrespective of their validity in the real world.

For added confidence, Fresnel predicted and verified that four total internal reflections at 68°27' would give an accurate circular polarization if two of the reflections had water as the external medium while the other two had air, but not if the reflecting surfaces were all wet or all dry.Fresnel, 1866, pp.761,793–6; Whewell, 1857, p.359. Using old experimental data, he promptly confirmed that the equations correctly predicted the direction of polarization of the reflected beam when the incident beam was polarized at 45° to the plane of incidence, for light incident from air onto glass or water.Buchwald, 1989, pp.390–91; Fresnel, 1866, pp.646–8. To obtain results that agreed with observations on partial reflection, they had to suppose, contrary to Fresnel, that the vibrations were within the plane of polarization.Powell, 1856, pp.4–5; Whittaker, 1910, p.149. thumb|left| George Gabriel Stokes (1819–1903). In each case there were two solutions, and in each case he reported that the larger angle of incidence gave an accurate circular polarization (for an initial linear polarization at 45° to the plane of reflection). The verification involved * calculating the angle of incidence that would introduce a total phase difference of 90° between the s and p components, for various numbers of total internal reflections at that angle (generally there were two solutions), * subjecting light to that number of total internal reflections at that angle of incidence, with an initial linear polarization at 45° to the plane of incidence, and * checking that the final polarization was circular.Fresnel, 1866, pp.760–61,792–6; Whewell, 1857, p.359. The Fresnel equations predict that light with the p polarization (electric field polarized in the same plane as the incident ray and the surface normal at the point of incidence) will not be reflected if the angle of incidence is :\theta_\mathrm{B} = \arctan\\!\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)\\!, where n1 is the refractive index of the initial medium through which the light propagates (the ""incident medium""), and n2 is the index of the other medium.

Under the Wigner map, the density matrix transforms into the equivalent Wigner function, : W(x,p) \,\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \, \frac{1}{\pi\hbar} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x + y) \psi(x - y) e^{2ipy/\hbar} \,dy. The equation for the time evolution of the Wigner function, known as Moyal equation, is then the Wigner- transform of the above von Neumann equation, :\frac{\partial W(x, p, t)}{\partial t} = -\\{\\{W(x, p, t), H(x, p)\\}\\}, where H(x,p) is the Hamiltonian, and \\{\\{\cdot,\cdot\\}\\} is the Moyal bracket, the transform of the quantum commutator. For a more general Hamiltonian, if G(t) is the wavefunction propagator over some interval, then the time evolution of the density matrix over that same interval is given by : \rho(t) = G(t) \rho(0) G(t)^\dagger. == Wigner functions and classical analogies == The density matrix operator may also be realized in phase space. The Wigner function represents a quantum system in a more general form than the wave function.

<<Context:>>
Some cosmologists and theoretical physicists have created models without the cosmological or Copernican principles to constrain the values of observational results, to address specific known issues in the Lambda-CDM model, and to propose tests to distinguish between current models and other possible models. The current standard model of cosmology is the Lambda-CDM model, wherein the Universe is governed by general relativity, began with a Big Bang and today is a nearly-flat universe that consists of approximately 5% baryons, 27% cold dark matter, and 68% dark energy.See the Planck Collaboration's 2015 data release. However, recent findings (the Axis of Evil for example) have suggested that violations of the cosmological principle exist in the universe and thus have called the ΛCDM model into question, with some authors suggesting that the cosmological principle is now obsolete and the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric breaks down in the late universe. === Violations of isotropy === The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is predicted by the ΛCDM model to be isotropic, that is to say that its intensity is about the same whichever direction we look at. That is, he asserted the equivalent material nature of all bodies within the Solar System, the identical nature of the Sun and distant stars and thus the uniform extension of the physical laws of motion to a great distance beyond the observational location of Earth itself. == Implications == Since the 1990s, observations have shown that, if one assumes the cosmological principle, then around 68% of the mass–energy density of the universe can be attributed to dark energy, which led to the development of the ΛCDM model. Since the late 1980s or 1990s, most cosmologists favor the cold dark matter theory (specifically the modern Lambda-CDM model) as a description of how the universe went from a smooth initial state at early times (as shown by the cosmic microwave background radiation) to the lumpy distribution of galaxies and their clusters we see today—the large-scale structure of the universe. However, recent findings have called the cosmological principle in ΛCDM model into question. 

<<Question:>>
What is one of the examples of the models proposed by cosmologists and theoretical physicists without the cosmological or Copernican principles that can be used to address specific issues in the Lambda-CDM model and distinguish between current models and other possible models?

<<Options:>>
A, The Copernican principle, which proposes that Earth, the Solar System, and the Milky Way are not at the centre of the universe, but instead, the universe is expanding equally in all directions. This principle is a modification of the Lambda-CDM model and has been shown to explain several observational results.
B, Inhomogeneous cosmology, which states that the universe is entirely homogeneous and isotropic, directly proportional to the density of matter and radiation. This model proposes that everything in the universe is completely uniform, but it does not match observations.
C, Inhomogeneous cosmology, which models the universe as an extremely large, low-density void, instead of using the concept of dark energy. According to the model, this theory can match the observed accelerating universe and cosmological constant, but it contradicts the Copernican principle.
D, The cosmological principle, which proposes that Earth, the Solar System, and the Milky Way are at the centre of the universe. This principle is a modification of the Lambda-CDM model and has been shown to explain several observational results.
E, The principle of dark energy, which proposes that a new form of energy, not previously detected, is responsible for the acceleration of the expansion of the universe. This principle is a modification of the Lambda-CDM model and has been shown to explain several observational results.

The Roche limit is the distance from a planet at which tidal effects would cause an object to disintegrate because the differential force of gravity from the planet overcomes the attraction of the parts of the object for one another. In celestial mechanics, the Roche limit, also called Roche radius, is the distance from a celestial body within which a second celestial body, held together only by its own force of gravity, will disintegrate because the first body's tidal forces exceed the second body's self-gravitation. It is also different from the Roche limit, which is the distance at which an object held together only by gravity begins to break up due to tidal forces. But note that, as defined above, the Roche limit refers to a body held together solely by the gravitational forces which cause otherwise unconnected particles to coalesce, thus forming the body in question. The Roche limit for a rigid spherical satellite is the distance, d, from the primary at which the gravitational force on a test mass at the surface of the object is exactly equal to the tidal force pulling the mass away from the object:see calculation in Frank H. Shu, The Physical Universe: an Introduction to Astronomy, p. 431, University Science Books (1982), . : d = R_M\left(2 \frac {\rho_M} {\rho_m} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} where R_M is the radius of the primary, \rho_M is the density of the primary, and \rho_m is the density of the satellite. The Roche limit is also usually calculated for the case of a circular orbit, although it is straightforward to modify the calculation to apply to the case (for example) of a body passing the primary on a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory. === Rigid satellites === The rigid-body Roche limit is a simplified calculation for a spherical satellite. 

<<Question:>>
What is the Roche limit?

<<Options:>>
A, The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to rotate since the forces exerted by two massive bodies produce a torque on a third object.
B, The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to unite since differential force from a planet results in parts becoming attracted to one another.
C, The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause a planet to disintegrate since differential force from an object overcomes the planet's core.
D, The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to disintegrate since differential force from a planet overcomes the attraction of the parts between them.
E, The Roche limit is the distance at which tidal effects would cause an object to break apart due to differential force from the planet overcoming the attraction of the parts of the object for one another, which depends on the object's density and composition, as well as the mass and size of the planet.

According to Martin Heidegger we do not exist inside time, we are time. Heidegger seems to think this is the way that a linear relationship with time, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended. ===Time=== Heidegger believes that time finds its meaning in death, according to Michael Kelley. Being and Time () is the 1927 magnum opus of German philosopher Martin Heidegger and a key document of existentialism. The Genesis of Heidegger's Being and Time (Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press, 1995), p. 568. Although Heidegger did not complete the project outlined in Being and Time, later works explicitly addressed the themes and concepts of Being and Time. 

<<Question:>>
What is Martin Heidegger's view on the relationship between time and human existence?

<<Options:>>
A, Martin Heidegger believes that humans exist within a time continuum that is infinite and does not have a defined beginning or end. The relationship to the past involves acknowledging it as a historical era, and the relationship to the future involves creating a world that will endure beyond one's own time.
B, Martin Heidegger believes that humans do not exist inside time, but that they are time. The relationship to the past is a present awareness of having been, and the relationship to the future involves anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement.
C, Martin Heidegger does not believe in the existence of time or that it has any effect on human consciousness. The relationship to the past and the future is insignificant, and human existence is solely based on the present.
D, Martin Heidegger believes that the relationship between time and human existence is cyclical. The past and present are interconnected and the future is predetermined. Human beings do not have free will.
E, Martin Heidegger believes that time is an illusion, and the past, present, and future are all happening simultaneously. Humans exist outside of this illusion and are guided by a higher power.

The ultraviolet catastrophe, also called the Rayleigh–Jeans catastrophe, was the prediction of late 19th century/early 20th century classical physics that an ideal black body at thermal equilibrium would emit an unbounded quantity of energy as wavelength decreased into the ultraviolet range.The term ""ultraviolet catastrophe"" was first used in 1911 by Paul Ehrenfest, but the concept originated with the 1900 statistical derivation of the Rayleigh–Jeans law. The ""ultraviolet catastrophe"" is the expression of the fact that the formula misbehaves at higher frequencies, i.e. B_{ u}(T) \to \infty as u \to \infty. The successful resolution of the original ultraviolet catastrophe has prompted the pursuit of solutions to other problems of ultraviolet divergence. The name comes from the earliest example of such a divergence, the ""ultraviolet catastrophe"" first encountered in understanding blackbody radiation. The word ""ultraviolet"" in this so-called ""ultraviolet regime"" is only figurative, and refers to energies much higher than ultraviolet light per se. Ultraviolet (UV) is a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelength shorter than that of visible light, but longer than X-rays. 

<<Question:>>
What is the ""ultraviolet catastrophe""?

<<Options:>>
A, It is a phenomenon that occurs only in multi-mode vibration.

However, the shower-curtain effect persists when cold water is used, implying that this cannot be the only mechanism at work. ===Bernoulli effect hypothesis === The most popular explanation given for the shower-curtain effect is Bernoulli's principle. The shower-curtain effect in physics describes the phenomenon of a shower curtain being blown inward when a shower is running. If air is moving across the inside surface of the shower curtain, Bernoulli's principle says the air pressure there will drop. In a steady state the steam will be replaced by new steam delivered by the shower but in reality the water temperature will fluctuate and lead to times when the net steam production is negative. ===Air pressure=== Colder dense air outside and hot less dense air inside causes higher air pressure on the outside to force the shower curtain inwards to equalise the air pressure, this can be observed simply when the bathroom door is open allowing cold air into the bathroom. ==Solutions== Many shower curtains come with features to reduce the shower-curtain effect. By pushing the curtain in towards the shower, the (short range) vortex and Coandă effects become more significant. This theory presumes that the water flowing out of a shower head causes the air through which the water moves to start flowing in the same direction as the water. 

<<Question:>>
What is the most popular explanation for the shower-curtain effect?

A related way to interpret the butterfly effect is to see it as highlighting the difference between the application of the notion of causality in physics and a more general use of causality as represented by Mackie's INUS conditions. The butterfly effect describes a phenomenon in chaos theory whereby a minor change in circumstances can cause a large change in outcome. In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. Whereas the classical butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the position and/or velocity of an object in a given Hamiltonian system, the quantum butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the Hamiltonian system with a given initial position and velocity. He noted that the butterfly effect is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as a distant butterfly flapping its wings several weeks earlier. The butterfly effect concept has since been used outside the context of weather science as a broad term for any situation where a small change is supposed to be the cause of larger consequences. ==History== In The Vocation of Man (1800), Johann Gottlieb Fichte says ""you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby ... changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole"".

C, The butterfly effect is a proportionality between the cause and the effect of a physical phenomenon in classical (Newtonian) physics.
D, The butterfly effect is a small push that is needed to set a massive sphere into motion when it is caused to roll down a slope starting from a point of unstable equilibrium.

The new phenomenon of a 'reactive Leidenfrost (RL) effect' was characterized by a dimensionless quantity, (φRL= τconv/τrxn), which relates the time constant of solid particle heat transfer to the time constant of particle reaction, with the reactive Leidenfrost effect occurring for 10−1< φRL< 10+1. The Leidenfrost temperatures for glycerol and common alcohols are significantly smaller because of their lower surface tension values (density and viscosity differences are also contributing factors.) == Reactive Leidenfrost effect == thumb|Reactive Leidenfrost effect of cellulose on silica, Non-volatile materials were discovered in 2015 to also exhibit a 'reactive Leidenfrost effect', whereby solid particles were observed to float above hot surfaces and skitter around erratically. When the temperature exceeds the Leidenfrost point, the Leidenfrost effect appears. The temperature of the solid surface beyond which the liquid undergoes the Leidenfrost phenomenon is termed the Leidenfrost temperature. The Leidenfrost effect has also been used as a means to promote chemical change of various organic liquids through their conversion by thermal decomposition into various products.

Reciprocal length or inverse length is a quantity or measurement used in several branches of science and mathematics. As the reciprocal of length, common units used for this measurement include the reciprocal metre or inverse metre (symbol: m−1), the reciprocal centimetre or inverse centimetre (symbol: cm−1). Quantities measured in reciprocal length include: *absorption coefficient or attenuation coefficient, in materials science *curvature of a line, in mathematics *gain, in laser physics *magnitude of vectors in reciprocal space, in crystallography *more generally any spatial frequency e.g. in cycles per unit length *optical power of a lens, in optics *rotational constant of a rigid rotor, in quantum mechanics *wavenumber, or magnitude of a wavevector, in spectroscopy *density of a linear feature in hydrology and other fields; see kilometre per square kilometre In optics, the dioptre is a unit equivalent to reciprocal metre. ==Measure of energy== In some branches of physics, the universal constants c, the speed of light, and ħ, the reduced Planck constant, are treated as being unity (i.e. that c = ħ = 1), which leads to mass, energy, momentum, frequency and reciprocal length all having the same unit. As a result, reciprocal length is used as a measure of energy. The energy is inversely proportional to the size of the unit of which the reciprocal is used, and is proportional to the number of reciprocal length units. For example, in terms of energy, one reciprocal metre equals (one hundredth) as much as a reciprocal centimetre.

The phase of the sinusoid varies with distance which results in the propagation constant being a complex number, the imaginary part being caused by the phase change. ==Alternative names== The term ""propagation constant"" is somewhat of a misnomer as it usually varies strongly with ω. The propagation constant of a sinusoidal electromagnetic wave is a measure of the change undergone by the amplitude and phase of the wave as it propagates in a given direction. The propagation constant itself measures the change per unit length, but it is otherwise dimensionless. Thus they are directly proportional to the frequency. :\alpha_d={{\pi}\sqrt{\varepsilon_r}\over{\lambda}}{\tan \delta} ===Optical fibre=== The attenuation constant for a particular propagation mode in an optical fiber is the real part of the axial propagation constant. ==Phase constant== In electromagnetic theory, the phase constant, also called phase change constant, parameter or coefficient is the imaginary component of the propagation constant for a plane wave. Note that in the field of transmission lines, the term transmission coefficient has a different meaning despite the similarity of name: it is the companion of the reflection coefficient. ==Definition== The propagation constant, symbol , for a given system is defined by the ratio of the complex amplitude at the source of the wave to the complex amplitude at some distance , such that, : \frac{A_0}{A_x} = e^{\gamma x} Since the propagation constant is a complex quantity we can write: : \gamma = \alpha + i \beta\ where * , the real part, is called the attenuation constant * , the imaginary part, is called the phase constant * i \equiv j \equiv \sqrt{ -1\ }\ ; more often is used for electrical circuits. The propagation constant for conducting lines can be calculated from the primary line coefficients by means of the relationship : \gamma= \sqrt{ Z Y\ } where : Z = R + i\ \omega L\ , the series impedance of the line per unit length and, : Y = G + i\ \omega C\ , the shunt admittance of the line per unit length. ===Plane wave=== The propagation factor of a plane wave traveling in a linear media in the direction is given by P = e^{-\gamma x} where * \gamma = \alpha + i\ \beta = \sqrt{i\ \omega\ \mu\ (\sigma + i\ \omega \varepsilon)\ }\ * x = distance traveled in the direction * \alpha =\ attenuation constant in the units of nepers/meter * \beta =\ phase constant in the units of radians/meter * \omega=\ frequency in radians/second * \sigma =\ conductivity of the media * \varepsilon = \varepsilon' - i\ \varepsilon \ = complex permitivity of the media * \mu = \mu' - i\ \mu \; = complex permeability of the media * i \equiv \sqrt{-1\ } The sign convention is chosen for consistency with propagation in lossy media. 

<<Question:>>
What is the propagation constant in sinusoidal waves?

<<Options:>>
A, The propagation constant is a measure of the amplitude of the sinusoidal wave that varies with distance.
B, The propagation constant is a real number that remains constant with distance due to the phase change in the sinusoidal wave.
C, The propagation constant is a real number that varies with distance due to the phase change in the sinusoidal wave.
D, The propagation constant is a complex number that varies with distance due to the phase change in the sinusoidal wave.

Gravitomagnetism is a widely used term referring specifically to the kinetic effects of gravity, in analogy to the magnetic effects of moving electric charge. This can be expressed as an attractive or repulsive gravitomagnetic component. In physics, the gravitomagnetic clock effect is a deviation from Kepler's third law that, according to the weak-field and slow-motion approximation of general relativity, will be suffered by a particle in orbit around a (slowly) spinning body, such as a typical planet or star. ==Explanation== According to general relativity, in its weak-field and slow-motion linearized approximation, a slowly spinning body induces an additional component of the gravitational field that acts on a freely-falling test particle with a non- central, gravitomagnetic Lorentz-like force. Gravitoelectromagnetism, abbreviated GEM, refers to a set of formal analogies between the equations for electromagnetism and relativistic gravitation; specifically: between Maxwell's field equations and an approximation, valid under certain conditions, to the Einstein field equations for general relativity. The main consequence of the gravitomagnetic field, or velocity-dependent acceleration, is that a moving object near a massive, non-axisymmetric, rotating object will experience acceleration not predicted by a purely Newtonian (gravitoelectric) gravity field. A group at Stanford University is currently analyzing data from the first direct test of GEM, the Gravity Probe B satellite experiment, to see whether they are consistent with gravitomagnetism.Gravitomagnetism in Quantum Mechanics, 2014 https://www.slac.stanford.edu/pubs/slacpubs/14750/slac-pub-14775.pdf The Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation also plans to observe gravitomagnetism effects. ==Equations== According to general relativity, the gravitational field produced by a rotating object (or any rotating mass–energy) can, in a particular limiting case, be described by equations that have the same form as in classical electromagnetism. 

<<Question:>>
What is the gravitomagnetic interaction?

<<Options:>>
A, The gravitomagnetic interaction is a force that is produced by the rotation of atoms in materials with linear properties that enhance time-varying gravitational fields.
B, The gravitomagnetic interaction is a force that acts against gravity, produced by materials that have nonlinear properties that enhance time-varying gravitational fields.
C, The gravitomagnetic interaction is a new force of nature generated by rotating matter, whose intensity is proportional to the rate of spin, according to the general theory of relativity.
D, The gravitomagnetic interaction is a force that occurs in neutron stars, producing a gravitational analogue of the Meissner effect.
E, The gravitomagnetic interaction is a force that is produced by the rotation of atoms in materials of different gravitational permeability.

Decay energy is usually quoted in terms of the energy units MeV (million electronvolts) or keV (thousand electronvolts): : Q \text{ [MeV]} = -931.5 \Delta M \text{ [Da]},~~(\text{where }\Delta M = \Sigma M_\text{products} - \Sigma M_\text{reactants}). The decay energy is the energy change of a nucleus having undergone a radioactive decay. In this type of free neutron decay, in essence all of the neutron decay energy is carried off by the antineutrino (the other ""body"").

There are several different versions of the transfer principle, depending on what model of nonstandard mathematics is being used.

It was introduced by Colin Maclaurin and studied by ,. and is also known as Young's geometry, named after the later work of John Wesley Young on finite geometry. ==Description== The Hesse configuration has the same incidence relations as the lines and points of the affine plane over the field of 3 elements. The transfer principle can also be viewed as a rigorous formalization of the principle of permanence.

Viruses are microscopic infectious agents composed of genetic material enclosed in a protein coat, requiring
a host cell to replicate. Protozoa, on the other hand, are single-celled eukaryotic microorganisms found in 
aquatic environments, with some being parasitic and causing diseases. Cells, as the fundamental units of life, 
possess a cell membrane, genetic material, and the ability to perform essential life processes. Gymnosperms, a 
group of seed-producing plants, produce ""naked seeds"" on cones and include species like pine trees and cycads.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

By expressing the shear tensor in terms of viscosity and fluid velocity, and assuming constant density and viscosity, the Cauchy momentum equation will lead to the Navier–Stokes equations. All non-relativistic momentum conservation equations, such as the Navier–Stokes equation, can be derived by beginning with the Cauchy momentum equation and specifying the stress tensor through a constitutive relation. The compressible momentum Navier–Stokes equation results from the following assumptions on the Cauchy stress tensor: * the stress is Galilean invariant: it does not depend directly on the flow velocity, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity. ==Incompressible flow== The incompressible momentum Navier–Stokes equation results from the following assumptions on the Cauchy stress tensor:Batchelor (1967) pp. 142–148. * the stress is Galilean invariant: it does not depend directly on the flow velocity, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity. All non-relativistic balance equations, such as the Navier–Stokes equations, can be derived by beginning with the Cauchy equations and specifying the stress tensor through a constitutive relation. The Navier–Stokes equations ( ) are partial differential equations which describe the motion of viscous fluid substances, named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes.

X-ray pulsar-based navigation and timing (XNAV) or simply pulsar navigation is a navigation technique whereby the periodic X-ray signals emitted from pulsars are used to determine the location of a vehicle, such as a spacecraft in deep space. A vehicle using XNAV would compare received X-ray signals with a database of known pulsar frequencies and locations. After the study, the interest in the XNAV technology within the European Space Agency was consolidated leading, in 2012, to two different and more detailed studies performed by GMV AEROSPACE AND DEFENCE (ES) and the National Physical Laboratory (UK). ===Experiments=== ;XPNAV 1: On 9 November 2016, the Chinese Academy of Sciences launched an experimental pulsar navigation satellite called XPNAV 1. The advantage of pulsar navigation would be more available signals than from satnav constellations, being unjammable, with the broad range of frequencies available, and security of signal sources from destruction by anti-satellite weapons. ==Types of pulsar for XNAV== Among pulsars, millisecond pulsars are good candidate to be space-time references. Experimental demonstrations have been reported in 2018.NASA test proves pulsars can function as a celestial GPS ==Spacecraft navigation== ===Studies=== The Advanced Concepts Team of ESA studied in 2003 the feasibility of x-ray pulsar navigation in collaboration with the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya in Spain. In particular, extraterrestrial intelligence might encode rich information using millisecond pulsar signals, and the metadata about XNAV is likely to be encoded by reference to millisecond pulsars.

<<Question:>>
What is the evidence for the existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy?

<<Options:>>
A, The Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center because of the bright flare activity observed near Sagittarius A*. The radius of the central object must be less than 17 light-hours, because otherwise S2 would collide with it. Observations of the star S14 indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit. No known astronomical object other than a black hole can contain 4.0 million M☉ in this volume of space.
B, The Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center because the star S14 follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2 years and a pericenter of 17 light-hours from the center of the central object. From the motion of star S14, the object's mass can be estimated as 4.0 million M☉, or about 7.96×1036 kg. The radius of the central object must be less than 17 light-hours, because otherwise S14 would collide with it. Observations of the star S2 indicate that the radius is no more than 6.25 light-hours, about the diameter of Uranus' orbit. No known astronomical object other than a black hole can contain 4.0 million M☉ in this volume of space.

No known astronomical object other than a black hole can contain 4.0 million M☉ in this volume of space.
D, The Milky Way galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center because it is the only explanation for the bright flare activity observed near Sagittarius A* at a separation of six to ten times the gravitational radius of the candidate SMBH.
E, The star S2 follows an elliptical orbit with a period of 15.2 years and a pericenter of 17 light-hours from the center of the central object.

In cardiology, the cardiac skeleton, also known as the fibrous skeleton of the heart, is a high-density homogeneous structure of connective tissue that forms and anchors the valves of the heart, and influences the forces exerted by and through them. This is the strongest part of the fibrous cardiac skeleton. Understood as such, the cardiac skeleton efficiently centers and robustly funnels electrical energy from the atria to the ventricles. ==Structure== The structure of the components of the heart has become an area of increasing interest. Fibrocyte cells normally secrete collagen, and function to provide structural support for the heart. While not a traditionally or ""true"" or rigid skeleton, it does provide structure and support for the heart, as well as isolate the atria from the ventricles. The cardiac skeleton separates and partitions the atria (the smaller, upper two chambers) from the ventricles (the larger, lower two chambers).The heart's cardiac skeleton comprises four dense connective tissue rings that encircle the mitral and tricuspid atrioventricular (AV) canals and extend to the origins of the pulmonary trunk and aorta. 

<<Question:>>
What is the function of the fibrous cardiac skeleton?

<<Options:>>
A, The fibrous cardiac skeleton is a system of blood vessels that supplies oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle.
B, The fibrous cardiac skeleton is responsible for the pumping action of the heart, regulating the flow of blood through the atria and ventricles.
C, The fibrous cardiac skeleton provides structure to the heart, forming the atrioventricular septum that separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings that serve as bases for the four heart valves.
D, The fibrous cardiac skeleton is a network of nerves that controls the heartbeat and rhythm of the heart.
E, The fibrous cardiac skeleton is a protective layer that surrounds the heart, shielding it from external damage.

Carnot's theorem is a formal statement of this fact: No engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between those same reservoirs. Other practical requirements that make the Carnot cycle hard to realize (e.g., fine control of the gas, thermal contact with the surroundings including high and low temperature reservoirs), so the Carnot engine should be thought as the theoretical limit of macroscopic scale heat engines rather than a practical device that could ever be built. ==See also== * Carnot heat engine * Reversible process (thermodynamics) ==References== ;Notes ;Sources :* Carnot, Sadi, Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire :* Ewing, J. A. (1910) The Steam-Engine and Other Engines edition 3, page 62, via Internet Archive :* :* :* :* American Institute of Physics, 2011. . Since a Carnot heat engine is a reversible heat engine, and all reversible heat engines operate with the same efficiency between the same reservoirs, we have the first part of Carnot's theorem: :No irreversible heat engine is more efficient than a Carnot heat engine operating between the same two thermal reservoirs. ==Definition of thermodynamic temperature== The efficiency of a heat engine is the work done by the engine divided by the heat introduced to the engine per engine cycle or {q_H} = \frac{q_H-q_C}{q_H} = 1 - \frac{q_C}{q_H}|}} where w_{cy} is the work done by the engine, q_C is the heat to the cold reservoir from the engine, and q_H is the heat to the engine from the hot reservoir, per cycle. This is the Carnot heat engine working efficiency definition as the fraction of the work done by the system to the thermal energy received by the system from the hot reservoir per cycle. The Carnot engine is the most efficient heat engine which is theoretically possible. From Carnot's theorem, for any engine working between these two temperatures: :\eta_{\rm th} \le 1 - \frac{T_{\rm C}}{T_{\rm H}} This limiting value is called the Carnot cycle efficiency because it is the efficiency of an unattainable, ideal, reversible engine cycle called the Carnot cycle.

A, The Carnot engine is a theoretical engine that operates in the limiting mode of extreme speed known as dynamic. It represents the theoretical maximum efficiency of a heat engine operating between any two given thermal or heat reservoirs at different temperatures.

C, The Carnot engine is a real heat engine that operates in the limiting mode of extreme speed known as dynamic. It represents the theoretical minimum efficiency of a heat engine operating between any two given thermal or heat reservoirs at different temperatures.

In engineering, a transfer function (also known as system functionBernd Girod, Rudolf Rabenstein, Alexander Stenger, Signals and systems, 2nd ed., Wiley, 2001, p. 50 or network function) of a system, sub-system, or component is a mathematical function that models the system's output for each possible input. For example, they do not exist for relaxation oscillators; however, describing functions can sometimes be used to approximate such nonlinear time-invariant systems. ==See also== == References == ==External links== * ECE 209: Review of Circuits as LTI Systems — Short primer on the mathematical analysis of (electrical) LTI systems. In mathematics, the exponential function can be characterized in many ways. It is a particularly useful construction for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems because it can be expressed in terms of the s-plane.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and

The second law of thermodynamics is a physical law based on universal experience concerning heat and energy interconversions. The second law of thermodynamics in other versions establishes the concept of entropy as a physical property of a thermodynamic system. The establishment of the concept of internal energy distinguishes the first law of thermodynamics from the more general law of conservation of energy. The second law may be formulated by the observation that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium where the entropy is highest at the given internal energy. The first law of thermodynamics is a formulation of the law of conservation of energy, adapted for thermodynamic processes. The second law defines the existence of a quantity called entropy, that describes the direction, thermodynamically, that a system can evolve and quantifies the state of order of a system and that can be used to quantify the useful work that can be extracted from the system. 

<<Question:>>

It establishes that the internal energy of a thermodynamic system is a physical property that can be used to predict whether processes are forbidden despite obeying the requirement of conservation of energy as expressed in the first law of thermodynamics.
C, The second law of thermodynamics is a physical law based on universal experience concerning heat and energy interconversions. It establishes that all heat energy can be converted into work in a cyclic process.

Amorphous metals can be grouped in two categories, as either non-ferromagnetic, if they are composed of Ln, Mg, Zr, Ti, Pd, Ca, Cu, Pt and Au, or ferromagnetic alloys, if they are composed of Fe, Co, and Ni. Amorphous (non- crystalline) ferromagnetic metallic alloys can be made by very rapid quenching (cooling) of a liquid alloy. Amorphous metals have higher tensile yield strengths and higher elastic strain limits than polycrystalline metal alloys, but their ductilities and fatigue strengths are lower. Their methods promise to speed up research and time to market for new amorphous metals alloys. ==Properties== Amorphous metal is usually an alloy rather than a pure metal. Amorphous alloys have a variety of potentially useful properties. Amorphous metals derive their strength directly from their non-crystalline structure, which does not have any of the defects (such as dislocations) that limit the strength of crystalline alloys. 

<<Question:>>
What are amorphous ferromagnetic metallic alloys, and what are their advantages?

<<Options:>>
A, Amorphous ferromagnetic metallic alloys are crystalline alloys that can be made by rapidly cooling a liquid alloy. Their properties are nearly anisotropic, resulting in low coercivity, low hysteresis loss, high permeability, and high electrical resistivity.
B, Amorphous ferromagnetic metallic alloys are non-crystalline alloys that can be made by slowly heating a solid alloy. Their properties are nearly isotropic, resulting in low coercivity, low hysteresis loss, high permeability, and high electrical resistivity.

The Penrose process (also called Penrose mechanism) is theorised by Sir Roger Penrose as a means whereby energy can be extracted from a rotating black hole.R. Penrose and R. M. Floyd, ""Extraction of Rotational Energy from a Black Hole"", Nature Physical Science 229, 177 (1971).Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler, Gravitation, Freeman and Company, 1973. The process takes advantage of the ergosphere – a region of spacetime around the black hole dragged by its rotation faster than the speed of light, meaning that from the point of an outside observer any matter inside is forced to move in the direction of the rotation of the black hole. thumb|upright=1.2|Trajectories of bodies in a Penrose process. However, this is not a reverse of the Penrose process, as both increase the entropy of the black hole by throwing material into it. == See also == * * * High Life, a 2018 science- fiction film that includes a mission to harness the process * == References == == Further reading == * * Category:Black holes Category:Energy sources Category:Hypothetical technology Penrose mechanism exploits that by diving into the ergosphere, dumping an object that was given negative energy, and returning with more energy than before. The energy is taken from the rotation of the black hole, so there is a limit on how much energy one can extract by Penrose process and similar strategies (for an uncharged black hole no more than 29% of its original mass;Carroll, Spacetime and Geometry pg. 271 larger efficiencies are possible for charged rotating black holes). == Details of the ergosphere == The outer surface of the ergosphere is the surface at which light that moves in the direction opposite to the rotation of the black hole remains at a fixed angular coordinate, according to an external observer. The maximum amount of energy gain possible for a single particle decay via the original (or classical) Penrose process is 20.7% of its mass in the case of an uncharged black hole (assuming the best case of maximal rotation of the black hole). 

<<Question:>>
What is the Penrose process?

<<Options:>>
A, The Penrose process is a mechanism through which objects can emerge from the ergosphere with less energy than they entered with, taking energy from the rotational energy of the black hole and speeding up its rotation.
B, The Penrose process is a mechanism through which objects can emerge from the ergosphere with the same energy as they entered with, taking energy from the rotational energy of the black hole and maintaining its rotation.
C, The Penrose process is a mechanism through which objects can emerge from the ergosphere with more energy than they entered with, taking extra energy from the rotational energy of the black hole and slowing down its rotation.
D, The Penrose process is a mechanism through which objects can emerge from the event horizon with less energy than they entered with, taking energy from the rotational energy of the black hole and speeding up its rotation.

His eventual solution, described in a letter to La Chambre dated 1 January 1662, construed ""resistance"" as inversely proportional to speed, so that light took the path of least time. Fermat replied that refraction might be brought into the same framework by supposing that light took the path of least resistance, and that different media offered different resistances. The ordinary law of refraction was at that time attributed to René Descartes (d.1650), who had tried to explain it by supposing that light was a force that propagated instantaneously, or that light was analogous to a tennis ball that traveled faster in the denser medium,Darrigol, 2012, pp.41–2. either premise being inconsistent with Fermat's. First proposed by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat in 1662, as a means of explaining the ordinary law of refraction of light (Fig.1), Fermat's principle was initially controversial because it seemed to ascribe knowledge and intent to nature. Laplace continued: > According to Huygens, the velocity of the extraordinary ray, in the crystal, > is simply expressed by the radius of the spheroid; consequently his > hypothesis does not agree with the principle of the least action: but it is > remarkable that it agrees with the principle of Fermat, which is, that light > passes, from a given point without the crystal, to a given point within it, > in the least possible time; for it is easy to see that this principle > coincides with that of the least action, if we invert the expression of the > velocity.Translated by Young (1809), p.341; Young's italics. left|thumb|Thomas Young Laplace's report was the subject of a wide-ranging rebuttal by Thomas Young, who wrote in part: > The principle of Fermat, although it was assumed by that mathematician on > hypothetical, or even imaginary grounds, is in fact a fundamental law with > respect to undulatory motion, and is the basis of every determination in the > Huygenian theory... He would hardly have thought this necessary if he had known that the principle of least time followed directly from the same common-tangent construction by which he had deduced not only the law of ordinary refraction, but also the laws of rectilinear propagation and ordinary reflection (which were also known to follow from Fermat's principle), and a previously unknown law of extraordinary refraction -- the last by means of secondary wavefronts that were spheroidal rather than spherical, with the result that the rays were generally oblique to the wavefronts. 

<<Question:>>

A, Fermat supposed that light took the path of least resistance, and that different media offered the same resistance. His eventual solution, described in a letter to La Chambre dated 1 January 1662, construed ""resistance"" as inversely proportional to speed, so that light took the path of least time. That premise yielded the ordinary law of refraction, provided that light traveled more slowly in the optically denser medium.
B, Fermat supposed that light took the path of least resistance, and that different media offered different resistances. His eventual solution, described in a letter to La Chambre dated 1 January 1662, construed ""resistance"" as directly proportional to speed, so that light took the path of least time. That premise yielded the ordinary law of refraction, provided that light traveled more quickly in the optically denser medium.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and

In physics, the spin quantum number is a quantum number (designated ) that describes the intrinsic angular momentum (or spin angular momentum, or simply spin) of an electron or other particle. The phrase spin quantum number was originally used to describe the fourth of a set of quantum numbers (the principal quantum number , the azimuthal quantum number , the magnetic quantum number , and the spin magnetic quantum number ), which completely describe the quantum state of an electron in an atom. In practice, spin is usually given as a dimensionless spin quantum number by dividing the spin angular momentum by the reduced Planck constant , which has the same dimensions as angular momentum. The conventional definition of the spin quantum number is , where can be any non- negative integer. At a more advanced level where quantum mechanical operators or coupled spins are introduced, is referred to as the spin quantum number, and is described as the spin magnetic quantum number or as the -component of spin . Often, the ""spin quantum number"" is simply called ""spin"". == Relation to classical rotation == The very earliest models for electron spin imagined a rotating charged mass, but this model fails when examined in detail: the required space distribution does not match limits on the electron radius: the required rotation speed exceeds the speed of light. 

<<Question:>>

<<Options:>>
A, The spin quantum number is a measure of the distance between an elementary particle and the nucleus of an atom.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a spontaneous process of symmetry breaking, by which a physical system in a symmetric state spontaneously ends up in an asymmetric state. The term ""spontaneous symmetry breaking"" is a misnomer here as Elitzur's theorem states that local gauge symmetries can never be spontaneously broken. Explicit symmetry breaking differs from spontaneous symmetry breaking. When a theory is symmetric with respect to a symmetry group, but requires that one element of the group be distinct, then spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred. Acting with the charge operator on the vacuum either annihilates the vacuum, if that is symmetric; else, if not, as is the case in spontaneous symmetry breaking, it produces a zero-frequency state out of it, through its shift transformation feature illustrated above. When the system goes to one of those vacuum solutions, the symmetry is broken for perturbations around that vacuum even though the entire Lagrangian retains that symmetry. ==Overview== By definition, spontaneous symmetry breaking requires the existence of physical laws (e.g. quantum mechanics) which are invariant under a symmetry transformation (such as translation or rotation), so that any pair of outcomes differing only by that transformation have the same probability distribution. 

<<Question:>>
What is spontaneous symmetry breaking?

<<Options:>>
A, Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the action of a theory has no symmetry, but the vacuum state has a symmetry. In that case, there will exist a local operator that is non-invariant under the symmetry, giving it a nonzero vacuum expectation value.
B, Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the action of a theory has a symmetry, and the vacuum state also has the same symmetry. In that case, there will exist a local operator that is invariant under the symmetry, giving it a zero vacuum expectation value.
C, Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the action of a theory has no symmetry, and the vacuum state also has no symmetry. In that case, there will exist a local operator that is invariant under the symmetry, giving it a zero vacuum expectation value.
D, Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the action of a theory has a symmetry, but the vacuum state violates this symmetry. In that case, there will exist a local operator that is invariant under the symmetry, giving it a zero vacuum expectation value.
E, Spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs when the action of a theory has a symmetry, but the vacuum state violates this symmetry. In that case, there will exist a local operator that is non-invariant under the symmetry, giving it a nonzero vacuum expectation value.

The deviation from the Hubble's law relationship between distance and redshift is altered, and this leads to inaccurate distance measurements. With a redshift of 5.47, light from this active galaxy is estimated to have taken around 12.3 billion light-years to reach Earth. Using Hubble's law, the redshift can be used to estimate the distance of an object from Earth.

Doppler also incorrectly believed that if a star were to exceed 136,000 kilometers per second in radial velocity, then it would not be visible to the human eye. === Later life === Doppler continued working as a professor at the Prague Polytechnic, publishing over 50 articles on mathematics, physics and astronomy, but in 1847 he left Prague for the professorship of mathematics, physics, and mechanics at the Academy of Mines and Forests (its successor is the University of Miskolc) in Selmecbánya (then Kingdom of Hungary, now Banská Štiavnica Slovakia). He studied the Doppler displacement of the spectral lines of stars to determine their radial velocities deducing a star's absolute dimensions, masses, and the orbital elements of some specific stars. In 1912, he was the first to observe the shift of spectral lines of galaxies, making him the discoverer of galactic redshifts.Slipher first reports on the making the first Doppler measurement on September 17, 1912 in The radial velocity of the Andromeda Nebula in the inaugural volume of the Lowell Observatory Bulletin, pp. 2.56–2.57. Forty years after Doppler's death the misnomer Johann Christian Doppler was introduced by the astronomer Julius Scheiner. In this work, Doppler postulated his principle (later named the Doppler effect) that the observed frequency of a wave depends on the relative speed of the source and the observer, and he later tried to use this concept to explain the visible colours of binary stars (this hypothesis was later proven wrong). He predicted that the small Doppler shifts to the light emitted by the star, caused by its continuously varying radial velocity, would be detectable by the most sensitive spectrographs as tiny redshifts and blueshifts in the star's emission.

The information content of a black hole appears to be lost when it dissipates, as under these models the Hawking radiation is random (it has no relation to the original information). Hawking radiation reduces the mass and rotational energy of black holes and is therefore also theorized to cause black hole evaporation. This perspective holds that Hawking's computation is reliable until the final stages of black-hole evaporation when information suddenly escapes. The information paradox appears when one considers a process in which a black hole is formed through a physical process and then evaporates away entirely through Hawking radiation. It is now generally believed that information is preserved in black-hole evaporation. Starting in the mid-1970s, Stephen Hawking and Jacob Bekenstein put forward theoretical arguments that suggested that black-hole evaporation loses information, and is therefore inconsistent with unitarity. 

<<Question:>>
What is the information loss paradox in black holes?

<<Options:>>
A, Black holes have an infinite number of internal parameters, so all the information about the matter that went into forming the black hole is preserved. Regardless of the type of matter which goes into a black hole, it appears that all the information is conserved. As black holes evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation, the information is lost forever.
B, Black holes have an infinite number of internal parameters, so all the information about the matter that went into forming the black hole is preserved. Regardless of the type of matter which goes into a black hole, it appears that all the information is conserved. As black holes evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation, the information is lost temporarily but reappears once the black hole has fully evaporated.
C, Black holes have only a few internal parameters, so most of the information about the matter that went into forming the black hole is lost. Regardless of the type of matter which goes into a black hole, it appears that only information concerning the total mass, charge, and angular momentum are conserved. As black holes evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation, the information is lost forever.
D, Black holes have only a few internal parameters, so most of the information about the matter that went into forming the black hole is lost. Regardless of the type of matter which goes into a black hole, it appears that only information concerning the total mass, charge, and angular momentum are conserved. As black holes evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation, the information is preserved and reappears once the black hole has fully evaporated.

The Kutta condition is a principle in steady-flow fluid dynamics, especially aerodynamics, that is applicable to solid bodies with sharp corners, such as the trailing edges of airfoils. The value of circulation of the flow around the airfoil must be that value which would cause the Kutta condition to exist. == The Kutta condition applied to airfoils == thumb|right|400px|Upper figure: Zero- circulation flow pattern around an airfoil. One of the consequences of the Kutta condition is that the airflow over the topside of the airfoil travels much faster than the airflow under the underside. The Kutta condition is an alternative method of incorporating some aspects of viscous effects, while neglecting others, such as skin friction and some other boundary layer effects. The Kutta–Joukowski theorem is a fundamental theorem in aerodynamics used for the calculation of lift of an airfoil (and any two-dimensional body including circular cylinders) translating in a uniform fluid at a constant speed large enough so that the flow seen in the body-fixed frame is steady and unseparated. In fluid flow around a body with a sharp corner, the Kutta condition refers to the flow pattern in which fluid approaches the corner from above and below, meets at the corner, and then flows away from the body. 

<<Question:>>
What is the Kutta condition?

<<Options:>>
A, The Kutta condition is a physical requirement that the fluid moving along the lower and upper surfaces of an airfoil meet smoothly, with no fluid moving around the trailing edge of the airfoil.
B, The Kutta condition is a physical requirement that the fluid moving along the lower and upper surfaces of an airfoil meet smoothly, with no fluid moving around the leading edge of the airfoil.
C, The Kutta condition is a mathematical requirement that the loop used in applying the Kutta-Joukowski theorem must be chosen outside the boundary layer of the airfoil.
D, The Kutta condition is a mathematical requirement that the flow can be assumed inviscid in the entire region outside the airfoil provided the Reynolds number is large and the angle of attack is small.
E, The Kutta condition is a physical requirement that the circulation calculated using the loop corresponding to the surface of the airfoil must be zero for a viscous fluid.

Classical mechanics is the branch of physics used to describe the motion of macroscopic objects. Classical mechanics utilises many equations--as well as other mathematical concepts--which relate various physical quantities to one another. Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. Dynamics is the branch of classical mechanics that is concerned with the study of forces and their effects on motion. As with classical mechanics, the subject can be divided into ""kinematics""; the description of motion by specifying positions, velocities and accelerations, and ""dynamics""; a full description by considering energies, momenta, and angular momenta and their conservation laws, and forces acting on particles or exerted by particles. The realization that the phase space in classical mechanics admits a natural description as a symplectic manifold (indeed a cotangent bundle in most cases of physical interest), and symplectic topology, which can be thought of as the study of global issues of Hamiltonian mechanics, has been a fertile area of mathematics research since the 1980s. ==See also== * Mechanics * Timeline of classical mechanics ==Notes== ==References== * * * Classical mechanics Category:Classical mechanics Category:Isaac Newton

Viruses are microscopic infectious agents composed of genetic material enclosed in a protein coat, requiring
a host cell to replicate. Protozoa, on the other hand, are single-celled eukaryotic microorganisms found in 
aquatic environments, with some being parasitic and causing diseases. Cells, as the fundamental units of life, 
possess a cell membrane, genetic material, and the ability to perform essential life processes. Gymnosperms, a 
group of seed-producing plants, produce ""naked seeds"" on cones and include species like pine trees and cycads.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

There are several proposed types of exotic matter: * Hypothetical particles and states of matter that have ""exotic"" physical properties that would violate known laws of physics, such as a particle having a negative mass. A large share of the published output of theoretical physicists consists of proposals for various forms of ""Beyond the Standard Model"" new physics proposals that would modify the Standard Model in ways subtle enough to be consistent with existing data, yet address its imperfections materially enough to predict non-Standard Model outcomes of new experiments that can be proposed. 400px|thumbnail|right|The Standard Model of elementary particles + hypothetical Graviton ===Phenomena not explained=== The Standard Model is inherently an incomplete theory. Such theories include alternative models of dark energy, such as quintessence, phantom energy and some ideas in brane cosmology; alternative models of dark matter, such as modified Newtonian dynamics; alternatives or extensions to inflation such as chaotic inflation and the ekpyrotic model; and proposals to supplement the universe with a first cause, such as the Hartle–Hawking boundary condition, the cyclic model, and the string landscape. Thus, there are several different models of dark matter interactions to consider. The Alternative models to the Standard Higgs Model are models which are considered by many particle physicists to solve some of the Higgs boson's existing problems. Additional features, such as overcoming conceptual flaws in either theory or accurate prediction of particle masses, would be desired.

In the more compact proximity-focusing design a thin radiator volume emits a cone of Cherenkov light which traverses a small distance, the proximity gap, and is detected on the photon detector plane. With a suitably focusing optical system this allows reconstruction of a ring, similar to that above, the radius of which gives a measure of the Cherenkov emission angle \theta_c . The image is a ring of light the radius of which is defined by the Cherenkov emission angle and the proximity gap. The ring-imaging Cherenkov, or RICH, detector is a device for identifying the type of an electrically charged subatomic particle of known momentum, that traverses a transparent refractive medium, by measurement of the presence and characteristics of the Cherenkov radiation emitted during that traversal. It is a design of a ring imaging Cherenkov detector where Cherenkov light that is contained by total internal reflection inside the solid radiator has its angular information preserved until it reaches the light sensors at the detector perimeter. thumb|right|The Cherenkov light is following a zigzag path between parallel surfaces. This article outlines the origins and principles of the RICH detector, with brief examples of its different forms in modern physics experiments. == Ring-imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector == === Origins === The ring-imaging detection technique was first proposed by Jacques Séguinot and Tom Ypsilantis, working at CERN in 1977.

The ferroelectric memristor's main advantages are that ferroelectric domain dynamics can be tuned, offering a way to engineer the memristor response, and that the resistance variations are due to purely electronic phenomena, aiding device reliability, as no deep change to the material structure is involved. ===Carbon nanotube memristor=== In 2013, Ageev, Blinov et al. reported observing memristor effect in structure based on vertically aligned carbon nanotubes studying bundles of CNT by scanning tunneling microscope. Later it was found that CNT memristive switching is observed when a nanotube has a non-uniform elastic strain ΔL0. It was shown that the memristive switching mechanism of strained СNT is based on the formation and subsequent redistribution of non-uniform elastic strain and piezoelectric field Edef in the nanotube under the influence of an external electric field E(x,t). ===Biomolecular memristor=== Biomaterials have been evaluated for use in artificial synapses and have shown potential for application in neuromorphic systems. The article was the first to demonstrate that a solid-state device could have the characteristics of a memristor based on the behavior of nanoscale thin films. High switching performance, demonstrated synaptic plasticity and sustainability to mechanical deformations promise to emulate the appealing characteristics of biological neural systems in novel computing technologies. === Atomristor === Atomristor is defined as the electrical devices showing memristive behavior in atomically thin nanomaterials or atomic sheets. In 2020, atomistic understanding of the conductive virtual point mechanism was elucidated in an article in nature nanotechnology. ===Ferroelectric memristor=== The ferroelectric memristor is based on a thin ferroelectric barrier sandwiched between two metallic electrodes.

C, Ferroelectric memristors have a more complex structure than other types of memristors, allowing for a wider range of applications.
D, Ferroelectric memristors have a unique piezoelectric field that allows for the creation of non-uniform elastic strain and a more stable structure.
E, Ferroelectric memristors are based on vertically aligned carbon nanotubes, which offer a more efficient and faster switching mechanism than other materials.

The modern understanding of the properties of a semiconductor relies on quantum physics to explain the movement of charge carriers in a crystal lattice. An (intrinsic) semiconductor has a band gap that is smaller than that of an insulator and at room temperature, significant numbers of electrons can be excited to cross the band gap.Charles Kittel (1995) Introduction to Solid State Physics, 7th ed. Wiley, . thumb|right|Schematic representation of an electron tunneling through a barrier In electronics/spintronics, a tunnel junction is a barrier, such as a thin insulating layer or electric potential, between two electrically conducting materials. Semiconductor mobility depends on the impurity concentrations (including donor and acceptor concentrations), defect concentration, temperature, and electron and hole concentrations. A semiconductor is a material which has an electrical conductivity value falling between that of a conductor, such as copper, and an insulator, such as glass. Variable-range hopping is a model used to describe carrier transport in a disordered semiconductor or in amorphous solid by hopping in an extended temperature range.

Resistivity is a fundamental material property which represents how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current. Soil resistivity is a measure of how much the soil resists or conducts electric current. The resistance is measured by a conductivity meter. The table below lists the resistivity of some common materials. There are different methods for measuring concrete resistivity. ==Laboratory methods== ===Two electrodes=== Concrete electrical resistance can be measured by applying a current using two electrodes attached to the ends of a uniform cross-section specimen. A resist, used in many areas of manufacturing and art, is something that is added to parts of an object to create a pattern by protecting these parts from being affected by a subsequent stage in the process.OED, ""Resist"", 3. 

<<Question:>>
What is resistivity?

<<Options:>>
A, Resistivity is an extrinsic property of a material that describes how difficult it is to make electrical current flow through it. It is measured in ohms and is dependent on the material's shape and size.

After his 1679–1680 correspondence with Hooke, described below, Newton adopted the language of inward or centripetal force. Newton also clearly expressed the concept of linear inertia in the 1660s: for this Newton was indebted to Descartes' work published 1644. ===Controversy with Hooke=== Hooke published his ideas about gravitation in the 1660s and again in 1674. In November 1679, Hooke began an exchange of letters with Newton, of which the full text is now published. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. Newton was well-versed in both classics and modern languages. Hooke had started an exchange of correspondence in November 1679 by writing to Newton, to tell Newton that Hooke had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence.Correspondence vol. 2 already cited, at p. 297.

Nicolaus Copernicus (; ; , ; 19 February 1473 – 24 May 1543) was a Renaissance polymath, active as a mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic canon, who formulated a model of the universe that placed the Sun rather than Earth at its center. Yet it ascribes to the Earth, that hulking, lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick as that of the aethereal torches, and a triple motion at that.”Owen Gingerich, The eye of heaven: Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, New York: American Institute of Physics, 1993, 181, Thus many astronomers accepted some aspects of Copernicus's theory at the expense of others. ==Copernican Revolution== The Copernican Revolution, a paradigm shift from the Ptolemaic model of the heavens, which described the cosmos as having Earth as a stationary body at the center of the universe, to the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System, spanned over a century, beginning with the publication of Copernus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium and ending with the work of Isaac Newton. Tycho, arguably the most accomplished astronomer of his time, appreciated the elegance of the Copernican system, but objected to the idea of a moving Earth on the basis of physics, astronomy, and religion. The men in this circle were astronomers who, under Melanchthon’s leadership, formed analysis of Copernican theory based on theory published in De revolutionibus.thumb|Illustration of Philipp Melanchthon |alt=|left === Philipp Melanchthon and Copernican Theory === Prior to the Copernican theory, Melanchthon strongly agreed with the work of Aristotle and Ptolemy. In an early unpublished manuscript of De Revolutionibus (which still survives), Copernicus mentioned the (non-heliocentric) 'moving Earth' theory of Philolaus and the possibility that Aristarchus also had a 'moving Earth' theory (though it is unlikely that he was aware that it was a heliocentric theory). Even forty-five years after the publication of De Revolutionibus, the astronomer Tycho Brahe went so far as to construct a cosmology precisely equivalent to that of Copernicus, but with the Earth held fixed in the center of the celestial sphere instead of the Sun.

The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe the motion of fluids. The Navier–Stokes equations ( ) are partial differential equations which describe the motion of viscous fluid substances, named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes. The Navier–Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest. Fluid motion is governed by the Navier–Stokes equations, a set of coupled and nonlinear partial differential equations derived from the basic laws of conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The Navier–Stokes equations mathematically express momentum balance and conservation of mass for Newtonian fluids. One way to understand the nonlinearity of the Navier-Stokes equations is to consider the term (v · ∇)v in the equations.

In hydrogen, its wavelength of 1215.67 angstroms ( or ), corresponding to a frequency of about , places Lyman-alpha in the ultraviolet (UV) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. A Lyman-Werner photon is an ultraviolet photon with a photon energy in the range of 11.2 to 13.6 eV, corresponding to the energy range in which the Lyman and Werner absorption bands of molecular hydrogen (H2) are found. The observed spectra consist of neutral hydrogen Lyman alpha absorption lines which are broadened by radiation damping. In physics and chemistry, the Lyman series is a hydrogen spectral series of transitions and resulting ultraviolet emission lines of the hydrogen atom as an electron goes from n ≥ 2 to n = 1 (where n is the principal quantum number), the lowest energy level of the electron. Lyman-alpha radiation had previously been detected from other galaxies, but due to interference from the Sun, the radiation from the Milky Way was not detectable. ==The Lyman series== The version of the Rydberg formula that generated the Lyman series was: {1 \over \lambda} = R_\text{H} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n^2} \right) \qquad \left( R_\text{H} \approx 1.0968{\times}10^7\,\text{m}^{-1} \approx \frac{13.6\,\text{eV}}{hc} \right) where n is a natural number greater than or equal to 2 (i.e., ). All the wavelengths in the Lyman series are in the ultraviolet band..

Furthermore, even classically, electric charge and angular momentum affect the properties of a black hole. A charged black hole is a black hole that possesses electric charge.

High switching performance, demonstrated synaptic plasticity and sustainability to mechanical deformations promise to emulate the appealing characteristics of biological neural systems in novel computing technologies. === Atomristor === Atomristor is defined as the electrical devices showing memristive behavior in atomically thin nanomaterials or atomic sheets. The article was the first to demonstrate that a solid-state device could have the characteristics of a memristor based on the behavior of nanoscale thin films. These atomristors offer forming-free switching and both unipolar and bipolar operation. Essentially, a resistor with memory able to perform logic operations and store information, it is a three-terminal implementation of the memristor. ==History== While the memristor is defined in terms of a two-terminal circuit element, there was an implementation of a three-terminal device called a memistor developed by Bernard Widrow in 1960. A memristor (; a portmanteau of memory resistor) is a non-linear two-terminal electrical component relating electric charge and magnetic flux linkage. A thyristor () is a solid-state semiconductor device with four layers of alternating P- and N-type materials used for high-power applications.

Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism have been called the ""second great unification in physics"" where the first one had been realised by Isaac Newton. San Francisco: San Francisco Press. ==Scientific work== ===Electromagnetic waves=== In 1864 Scottish mathematical physicist James Clerk Maxwell proposed a comprehensive theory of electromagnetism, now called Maxwell's equations. The final form of Maxwell's equations was published in 1865 A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field, in which the theory is formulated in strictly mathematical form. Chapters six through eight present the development of electromagnetism as a line from Faraday to Maxwell, including the development of theories of electricity and magnetism modelled on Newtonian mechanics. His demonstrations established that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field; this relation was modelled mathematically by James Clerk Maxwell as Faraday's law, which subsequently became one of the four Maxwell equations, and which have in turn evolved into the generalization known today as field theory. James Clerk Maxwell took the work of Faraday and others and summarized it in a set of equations which is accepted as the basis of all modern theories of electromagnetic phenomena.

The coherence encountered in most optical experiments, including the classic Young's double slit experiment and Mach–Zehnder interferometer, is first order coherence. Young's double slit experiment demonstrates the dependence of interference on coherence, specifically on the first-order correlation. The interferometric visibility gives a practical way to measure the coherence of two waves (or one wave with itself). This experiment is equivalent to the Mach–Zehnder interferometer with the caveat that Young's double slit experiment is concerned with spatial coherence, while the Mach–Zehnder interferometer relies on temporal coherence. The coherence length can also be measured using a Michelson interferometer and is the optical path length difference of a self-interfering laser beam which corresponds to \, \frac{1}{\, e \,} \approx 37\% \, fringe visibility, where the fringe visibility is defined as :V = \frac{\; I_\max - I_\min \;}{ I_\max + I_\min} ~, where \, I \, is the fringe intensity. A property of low coherence interferometry is that interference, i.e. the series of dark and bright fringes, is only achieved when the path difference lies within the coherence length of the light source.

Now, suppose one wishes to employ canonical quantization, then the phase-space coordinates become operators whose commutators become times their classical Poisson bracket. Then, this quotient algebra is converted into a Poisson algebra by introducing a Poisson bracket derivable from the action, called the Peierls bracket. When applying canonical quantization on a constrained Hamiltonian system, the commutator of the operators is supplanted by times their classical Dirac bracket. 

<<Question:>>

<<Options:>>
A, The Peierls bracket is a mathematical symbol used to represent the Poisson algebra in the canonical quantization method.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and

The demon must allow molecules to pass in both directions in order to produce only a temperature difference; one-way passage only of faster-than-average molecules from A to B will cause higher temperature and pressure to develop on the B side. == Criticism and development == Several physicists have presented calculations that show that the second law of thermodynamics will not actually be violated, if a more complete analysis is made of the whole system including the demon. William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) was the first to use the word ""demon"" for Maxwell's concept, in the journal Nature in 1874, and implied that he intended the Greek mythology interpretation of a daemon, a supernatural being working in the background, rather than a malevolent being. == Original thought experiment == The second law of thermodynamics ensures (through statistical probability) that two bodies of different temperature, when brought into contact with each other and isolated from the rest of the Universe, will evolve to a thermodynamic equilibrium in which both bodies have approximately the same temperature. right|340px|thumb|Schematic figure of Maxwell's demon thought experiment Maxwell's demon is a thought experiment that would hypothetically violate the second law of thermodynamics. The operation of the demon is directly observed as a temperature drop in the system, with a simultaneous temperature rise in the demon arising from the thermodynamic cost of generating the mutual information. In the thought experiment, a demon controls a small massless door between two chambers of gas. Only a year later and based on an earlier theoretical proposal, the same group presented the first experimental realization of an autonomous Maxwell's demon, which extracts microscopic information from a system and reduces its entropy by applying feedback.

This experiment measured the magnetic fields of four superconducting gyroscopes to determine their spin axes. It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor during its transitions into the superconducting state. In the quantum vortex, supercurrent circulates around the normal (i.e. non-superconducting) core of the vortex. The results were strongly supported by Monte Carlo computer simulations. === Meissner effect === When a superconductor is placed in a weak external magnetic field H, and cooled below its transition temperature, the magnetic field is ejected. Another scenario where there is an interplay between magnetic and superconducting order in the same material is superconductors with spiral or helical magnetic order. Most pure elemental superconductors, except niobium and carbon nanotubes, are Type I, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are Type II. === London moment === Conversely, a spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field, precisely aligned with the spin axis.

Direct detection of dark matter is the science of attempting to directly measure dark matter collisions in Earth-based experiments. There are three main avenues of research to detect dark matter: attempts to make dark matter in accelerators, indirect detection of dark matter annihilation, and direct detection of dark matter in terrestrial labs.

The simplest type of gas pycnometer (due to its relative lack of moving parts) consists of two chambers, one (with a removable gas-tight lid) to hold the sample and a second chamber of fixed, known (via calibration) internal volume – referred to as the reference volume or added volume. A gas pycnometer is also sometimes referred to as a helium pycnometer. ==Types of gas pycnometer== ===Gas expansion pycnometer=== Gas expansion pycnometer is also known as constant volume gas pycnometer. The volume measured in a gas pycnometer is that amount of three-dimensional space which is inaccessible to the gas used, i.e. that volume within the sample chamber from which the gas is excluded. Pyknometer is to be found in older texts, and is used interchangeably with pycnometer in British English. In practice the sample may occupy either chamber, that is gas pycnometers can be constructed such that the sample chamber is pressurized first, or such that it is the reference chamber that starts at the higher pressure.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

Bollard pull is a conventional measure of the pulling (or towing) power of a watercraft. Bollard pull is primarily (but not only) used for measuring the strength of tugboats, with the largest commercial harbour tugboats in the 2000-2010s having around of bollard pull, which is described as above ""normal"" tugboats. The bollard pull of a vessel may be reported as two numbers, the static or maximum bollard pull – the highest force measured – and the steady or continuous bollard pull, the average of measurements over an interval of, for example, 10 minutes. In the English system units, HP = {R\times v\over550} ==Measurement== Values for bollard pull can be determined in two ways. ===Practical trial=== thumb|Figure 1: bollard pull trial under ideal (imaginary) conditions This method is useful for one-off ship designs and smaller shipyards. There, bollard pull is often a category in competitions and gives an indication of the power train efficiency. Bollard pull values are stated in tonnes-force (written as t or tonnef) or kilonewtons (kN).Note the inherent conflict: the SI unit of force is the newton.

For example, a 1 cm3 cube of quartz with 2 kN (500 lbf) of correctly applied force can produce a voltage of 12500 V. Piezoelectric materials also show the opposite effect, called the converse piezoelectric effect, where the application of an electrical field creates mechanical deformation in the crystal. ===Mathematical description=== Linear piezoelectricity is the combined effect of * The linear electrical behavior of the material: : \mathbf{D} = \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\,\mathbf{E} \quad \implies \quad D_i = \sum_{j}\varepsilon_{ij}\,E_j \; : where D is the electric flux densityIEC 80000-6, item 6-12 (electric displacement), ε is the permittivity (free-body dielectric constant), E is the electric field strength, and abla\cdot\mathbf{D} = 0 , abla \times \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{0} . Within a certain range of strain this relationship is linear, so that the piezoresistive coefficient : \rho_\sigma = \frac{\left(\frac{\partial\rho}{\rho}\right)}{\varepsilon} where :∂ρ = Change in resistivity :ρ = Original resistivity :ε = Strain is constant. === Piezoresistivity in metals === Usually the resistance change in metals is mostly due to the change of geometry resulting from applied mechanical stress. The high modulus of elasticity of many piezoelectric materials is comparable to that of many metals and goes up to 106 N/m². To first order, there is only one independent piezoelectric coefficient in zincblende, called e14, coupled to shear components of the strain. Also, several ferroelectrics with perovskite-structure (BaTiO3 [BT], (Bi1/2Na1/2) TiO3 [BNT], (Bi1/2K1/2) TiO3 [BKT], KNbO3 [KN], (K, Na) NbO3 [KNN]) have been investigated for their piezoelectric properties. == Key piezoelectric properties == The following table lists the following properties for piezoelectric materials * The piezoelectric coefficients (d33, d31, d15 etc.) measure the strain induced by an applied voltage (expressed as meters per volt). Gautschi in Piezoelectric Sensorics (2002) offers this comparison table of characteristics of piezo sensor materials vs other types: Principle Strain sensitivity [V/µε] Threshold [µε] Span to threshold ratio Piezoelectric 5.0 0.00001 100,000,000 Piezoresistive 0.0001 0.0001 2,500,000 Inductive 0.001 0.0005 2,000,000 Capacitive 0.005 0.0001 750,000 Resistive 0.000005 0.01 50,000 One disadvantage of piezoelectric sensors is that they cannot be used for truly static measurements.

""Density function"" itself is also used for the probability mass function, leading to further confusion.Ord, J.K. (1972) Families of Frequency Distributions, Griffin. (for example, Table 5.1 and Example 5.4) In general though, the PMF is used in the context of discrete random variables (random variables that take values on a countable set), while the PDF is used in the context of continuous random variables. ==Example== Suppose bacteria of a certain species typically live 4 to 6 hours. In other sources, ""probability distribution function"" may be used when the probability distribution is defined as a function over general sets of values or it may refer to the cumulative distribution function, or it may be a probability mass function (PMF) rather than the density. The probability mass function is therefore sometimes referred to as the discrete density function. The probability mass function of a discrete random variable is the density with respect to the counting measure over the sample space (usually the set of integers, or some subset thereof). The terms probability distribution function and probability function have also sometimes been used to denote the probability density function.

For the first few years of the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment, the distance between the observatory and the reflectors could be measured to an accuracy of about . The instantaneous precision of the Lunar Laser Ranging experiments can achieve few millimeter resolution, and is the most reliable method of determining the lunar distance to date. The measurement is also useful in characterizing the lunar radius, as well as the mass of and distance to the Sun. Millimeter-precision measurements of the lunar distance are made by measuring the time taken for laser beam light to travel between stations on Earth and retroreflectors placed on the Moon. The distance can be calculated from the round-trip time of laser light pulses travelling at the speed of light, which are reflected back to Earth by the Moon's surface or by one of five retroreflectors installed on the Moon during the Apollo program (11, 14, and 15) and Lunokhod 1 and 2 missions. Follow-on experiments lasting one month produced a semi-major axis of ( ± ), which was the most precise measurement of the lunar distance at the time. === Laser ranging === thumb|Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment from the Apollo 11 mission An experiment which measured the round-trip time of flight of laser pulses reflected directly off the surface of the Moon was performed in 1962, by a team from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a Soviet team at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory.

In physical cosmology, the baryon asymmetry problem, also known as the matter asymmetry problem or the matter–antimatter asymmetry problem, is the observed imbalance in baryonic matter (the type of matter experienced in everyday life) and antibaryonic matter in the observable universe. Project Ozma was a search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) experiment started in 1960 by Cornell University astronomer Frank Drake, at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank at Green Bank, West Virginia. Symmetry is a monthly peer-reviewed open access scientific journal published by MDPI covering several aspects of theories and applications related to symmetry/asymmetry phenomena in the natural sciences. The OZI rule is a consequence of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) that explains why certain decay modes appear less frequently than otherwise might be expected. In ordinary ozone, the atoms are arranged in a bent line; in cyclic ozone, they would form an equilateral triangle. Another major problem in cosmology is what caused the universe to contain far more matter than antimatter.

The 'speed of light' in this article refers to the speed of all electromagnetic radiation in vacuum. == The two-way speed == The two-way speed of light is the average speed of light from one point, such as a source, to a mirror and back again. In this context, the ""speed of light"" refers to the limiting speed c of the theory rather than to the velocity of propagation of photons. ==Historical proposals== ===Background=== Einstein's equivalence principle, on which general relativity is founded, requires that in any local, freely falling reference frame, the speed of light is always the same. In electromagnetism, electromagnetic waves in vacuum travel at the speed of light c, according to Maxwell's Equations. See the book 2012 e-book. he measured the speed of light in air to be 299,864 ± 51 kilometres per second, and estimated the speed of light in a vacuum as 299,940 km/s, or 186,380 mi/s. The invariance of the speed of light is one of the postulates of special relativity, and the terms speed of light and invariant speed are often considered synonymous. When using the term 'the speed of light' it is sometimes necessary to make the distinction between its one-way speed and its two-way speed.

which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a

Emissivity, defined as a further proportionality factor to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, was thus implied and utilized in subsequent evaluations of the radiative behavior of grey bodies. By 1900 Max Planck empirically derived a generalized law of blackbody radiation, thus clarifying the emissivity and absorptivity concepts at individual wavelengths. ==Other radiometric coefficients== ==See also== * Albedo * Black-body radiation * Passive daytime radiative cooling * Radiant barrier * Reflectance * Sakuma–Hattori equation * Stefan–Boltzmann law * View factor * Wien's displacement law ==References== ==Further reading== * An open community- focused website & directory with resources related to spectral emissivity and emittance. Quantitatively, it is the ratio of the thermal radiation from a surface to the radiation from an ideal black surface at the same temperature as given by the Stefan–Boltzmann law. The Stefan–Boltzmann law, also known as Stefan's law, describes the intensity of the thermal radiation emitted by matter in terms of that matter's temperature. A so-called grey body is a body for which the spectral emissivity is independent of wavelength, so that the total emissivity, \varepsilon, is a constant. For an ideal absorber/emitter or black body, the Stefan–Boltzmann law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area per unit time (also known as the radiant exitance) is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's temperature, T: : M^{\circ} = \sigma\, T^{4}.

This is a natural consequence of their low temperatures and high densities, because the gravitational force acting to collapse the cloud must exceed the internal pressures that are acting ""outward"" to prevent a collapse. There is observed evidence that the large, star-forming clouds are confined to a large degree by their own gravity (like stars, planets, and galaxies) rather than by external pressure. The theory of low-mass star formation, which is well- supported by observation, suggests that low-mass stars form by the gravitational collapse of rotating density enhancements within molecular clouds. In triggered star formation, one of several events might occur to compress a molecular cloud and initiate its gravitational collapse. A molecular cloud, sometimes called a stellar nursery (if star formation is occurring within), is a type of interstellar cloud, the density and size of which permit absorption nebulae, the formation of molecules (most commonly molecular hydrogen, H2), and the formation of H II regions. These clouds have a typical density of 30 particles per cubic centimetre. ==Processes== ===Star formation=== The formation of stars occurs exclusively within molecular clouds. 

<<Question:>>

<<Options:>>
A, The formation of stars occurs exclusively outside of molecular clouds.
B, The low temperatures and high densities of molecular clouds cause the gravitational force to exceed the internal pressures that are acting ""outward"" to prevent a collapse.

The need for such an identity operation arises from the mathematical requirements of group theory. === Reflection through mirror planes === thumb|Reflection operation The reflection operation is carried out with respect to symmetry elements known as planes of symmetry or mirror planes. In group theory, geometry, representation theory and molecular geometry, a symmetry operation is a geometric transformation of an object that leaves the object looking the same after it has been carried out. It forms the identity element in the symmetry group. For example, with the point group C3, there are three symmetry operations: rotation by 120°, C3, rotation by 240°, C32 and rotation by 360°, which is equivalent to identity, E.thumb|C2v point group multiplication tab : Point group C3 Multiplication table E C3 C32 E E C3 C32 C3 C3 C32 E C32 C32 E C3 2.

Thus we can define a regular polytope very succinctly: *A regular polytope is one whose symmetry group is transitive on its flags. Regular polytopes are the generalized analog in any number of dimensions of regular polygons (for example, the square or the regular pentagon) and regular polyhedra (for example, the cube). An abstract polytope is said to be regular if its combinatorial symmetries are transitive on its flags - that is to say, that any flag can be mapped onto any other under a symmetry of the polyhedron. An abstract polytope is said to be regular if its combinatorial symmetries are transitive on its flags – that is to say, that any flag can be mapped onto any other under a symmetry of the polyhedron. *And so on, a regular n-polytope is an n-dimensional polytope whose (n − 1)-dimensional faces are all regular and congruent, and whose vertex figures are all regular and congruent. * An n-polytope is regular if any set consisting of a vertex, an edge containing it, a 2-dimensional face containing the edge, and so on up to n−1 dimensions, can be mapped to any other such set by a symmetry of the polytope.

Similarly, if two conductors are near each other carrying AC current, their resistances increase due to the proximity effect. In electromagnetics, proximity effect is a redistribution of electric current occurring in nearby parallel electrical conductors carrying alternating current flowing in the same direction which causes the current distribution in the conductor to concentrate on the side away from the nearby conductor. The proximity effect can significantly increase the AC resistance of adjacent conductors when compared to its resistance to a DC current. For nearby wires, e.g. in a cable or a coil, the AC resistance is also affected by proximity effect, which can cause an additional increase in the AC resistance. == Material effect on skin depth == In a good conductor, skin depth is proportional to square root of the resistivity. The result is that the current is concentrated in the areas of the conductor farthest away from nearby conductors carrying current in the same direction. Contact electrification is a phrase that describes the phenomenon whereby two surfaces become electrically charged when they contact and then separate. 

<<Question:>>
What is the reason behind the largest externally observed electrical effects when two conductors are separated by the smallest distance without touching?

<<Options:>>

In this formalism, angular momentum is the 2-form Noether charge associated with rotational invariance. The symmetry associated with conservation of angular momentum is rotational invariance. The close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in Noether's theorem that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariant. == Angular momentum in electrodynamics == When describing the motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field, the canonical momentum P (derived from the Lagrangian for this system) is not gauge invariant. According to Noether's theorem, if the action (the integral over time of its Lagrangian) of a physical system is invariant under rotation, then angular momentum is conserved. === Application to quantum mechanics === In quantum mechanics, rotational invariance is the property that after a rotation the new system still obeys Schrödinger's equation. In terms of abstract algebra, the invariance of angular momentum, four-momentum, and other symmetries in spacetime, are described by the Lorentz group, or more generally the Poincaré group. In physics, angular momentum (sometimes called moment of momentum or rotational momentum) is the rotational analog of linear momentum.

The geometry of Minkowski space can be depicted using Minkowski diagrams, which are useful also in understanding many of the thought experiments in special relativity. === Physics in spacetime === ====Transformations of physical quantities between reference frames==== Above, the Lorentz transformation for the time coordinate and three space coordinates illustrates that they are intertwined. Some authors of textbooks use symmetric Minkowski diagrams, denoting as Loedel diagrams. == Relativistic phenomena in diagrams == === Time dilation === thumb|right|400px|Fig 4-1. A Minkowski diagram is a two- dimensional graphical depiction of a portion of Minkowski space, usually where space has been curtailed to a single dimension. Since the 1960s a version of this more complete configuration has been referred to as The Minkowski Diagram, and used as a standard illustration of the transformation geometry of special relativity.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

<<Context:>>
The formation of antimatter galaxies was originally thought to explain the baryon asymmetry, as from a distance, antimatter atoms are indistinguishable from matter atoms; both produce light (photons) in the same way. This asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the great unsolved problems in physics. There is strong evidence that the observable universe is composed almost entirely of ordinary matter, as opposed to an equal mixture of matter and antimatter. The presence of remaining matter, and absence of detectable remaining antimatter, is called baryon asymmetry. The behavioral differences between matter and antimatter are specific to each individual experiment. In physical cosmology, the baryon asymmetry problem, also known as the matter asymmetry problem or the matter–antimatter asymmetry problem, is the observed imbalance in baryonic matter (the type of matter experienced in everyday life) and antibaryonic matter in the observable universe. 

<<Question:>>
What are the two main interpretations for the disparity between the presence of matter and antimatter in the observable universe?

<<Options:>>
A, The universe began with a small preference for matter, or it was originally perfectly asymmetric, but a set of phenomena contributed to a small imbalance in favor of antimatter over time.
B, The universe began with a small preference for antimatter, or it was originally perfectly symmetric, but a set of phenomena contributed to a small imbalance in favor of antimatter over time.
C, The universe began with equal amounts of matter and antimatter, or it was originally perfectly symmetric, but a set of phenomena contributed to a small imbalance in favor of antimatter over time.

The Ramsauer–Townsend effect, also sometimes called the Ramsauer effect or the Townsend effect, is a physical phenomenon involving the scattering of low- energy electrons by atoms of a noble gas. It was here that he conducted research on the quantum effect of the transparency of noble gases to slow electrons, known as the Ramsauer–Townsend effect. This is the Ramsauer–Townsend effect. The effect can not be explained by Classical mechanics, but requires the wave theory of quantum mechanics. == Definitions == When an electron moves through a gas, its interactions with the gas atoms cause scattering to occur. thumb|right|Ramsauer in 1928 Carl Wilhelm Ramsauer (6 February 1879 – 24 December 1955) was a German professor of physics and research physicist, famous for the discovery of the Ramsauer–Townsend effect.

Accordingly, the emergent long-range behavior that always accompanies dynamical chaos and its derivatives such as turbulence and self- organized criticality can be understood as a consequence of the Goldstone theorem. == History and relation to other theories == The first relation between supersymmetry and stochastic dynamics was established in two papers in 1979 and 1982 by Giorgio Parisi and Nicolas Sourlas, who demonstrated that the application of the BRST gauge fixing procedure to Langevin SDEs, i.e., to SDEs with linear phase spaces, gradient flow vector fields, and additive noises, results in N=2 supersymmetric models. Supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics or stochastics (STS) is an exact theory of stochastic (partial) differential equations (SDEs), the class of mathematical models with the widest applicability covering, in particular, all continuous time dynamical systems, with and without noise. In the domain of applicability of stochastic differential equations including, e.g, classical physics, spontaneous supersymmetry breaking encompasses such nonlinear dynamical phenomena as chaos, turbulence, pink noise, etc. ==Supersymmetry breaking scale== In particle physics, supersymmetry breaking scale is the energy scale where supersymmetry breaking takes place. The theory identifies a model as chaotic, in the generalized, stochastic sense, if its ground state is not supersymmetric, i.e., if the supersymmetry is broken spontaneously. Within STS, spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry is indeed a nontrivial dynamical phenomenon that has been variously known across disciplines as chaos, turbulence, self-organized criticality etc. A similar approach was used to establish that classical mechanics, its stochastic generalization, and higher-order Langevin SDEs also have supersymmetric representations. 

<<Question:>>
What is the interpretation of supersymmetry in stochastic supersymmetric theory?

<<Options:>>
A, Supersymmetry is a type of hydromagnetic dynamo that arises when the magnetic field becomes strong enough to affect the fluid motions.
B, Supersymmetry is a measure of the amplitude of the dynamo in the induction equation of the kinematic approximation.
C, Supersymmetry is a measure of the strength of the magnetic field in the induction equation of the kinematic dynamo.
D, Supersymmetry is a property of deterministic chaos that arises from the continuity of the flow in the model's phase space.
E, Supersymmetry is an intrinsic property of all stochastic differential equations, and it preserves continuity in the model's phase space via continuous time flows.

This concept is derived from the map scale in cartography. * Cartographic scale or map scale: a large-scale map covers a smaller area but embodies more detail, while a small-scale map covers a larger area with less detail. In Western culture, map extents usually have a rectangular shape, so they are defined with a minimum and maximum width and height. Thus, many projections exist to serve the many uses of maps and their vast range of scales. Therefore, a drawing will indicate both its scale (ratio) and the unit of measurement being used.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

Indirect photophoresis occurs as a result of an increase in the kinetic energy of molecules when particles absorb incident light only on the irradiated side, thus creating a temperature gradient within the particle. Under certain conditions, with particles of diameter comparable to the wavelength of light, the phenomenon of a negative indirect photophoresis occurs, due to the unequal heat generation on the laser irradiation between the back and front sides of particles, this produces a temperature gradient in the medium around the particle such that molecules at the far side of the particle from the light source may get to heat up more, causing the particle to move towards the light source. Separately from photophoresis, in a fluid mixture of different kinds of particles, the migration of some kinds of particles may be due to differences in their absorptions of thermal radiation and other thermal effects collectively known as thermophoresis. Photophoresis denotes the phenomenon that small particles suspended in gas (aerosols) or liquids (hydrocolloids) start to migrate when illuminated by a sufficiently intense beam of light. In laser photophoresis, particles migrate once they have a refractive index different from their surrounding medium. Indirect, the opposite of direct, may refer to: *Indirect approach, a battle strategy *Indirect DNA damage, caused by UV-photons *Indirect agonist or indirect-acting agonist, a substance that enhances the release or action of an endogenous neurotransmitter *Indirect speech, a form of speech *Indirect costs, costs that are not directly accountable to a particular function or product *Indirect self-reference, describes an object referring to itself indirectly *Indirect effect, a principle of European Community Law *Indirect finance, where borrowers borrow funds from the financial market through indirect means *Indirection, the ability to reference something in computer programming *Indirect transmission, infections passing from one host to another via a different species. ==See also== *

C, Indirect photophoresis is a phenomenon that occurs when particles absorb incident light uniformly, creating a temperature gradient within the particle, and causing a migration of particles in the same direction as the surface temperature gradient.
D, Indirect photophoresis is a phenomenon that occurs when particles absorb incident light only on the irradiated side, creating a temperature gradient within the particle, and causing a migration of particles in a direction opposite to the surface temperature gradient.

Earnshaw's theorem states that a collection of point charges cannot be maintained in a stable stationary equilibrium configuration solely by the electrostatic interaction of the charges. On the other hand, Earnshaw's theorem only applies to point charges, but not to distributed charges. Since Earnshaw's theorem only applies to stationary charges, there were attempts to explain stability of atoms using planetary models, such as Nagaoka's Saturnian model (1904) and Rutherford's planetary model (1911), where the point electrons are circling a positive point charge in the center. Earnshaw's theorem applies to classical inverse-square law forces (electric and gravitational) and also to the magnetic forces of permanent magnets, if the magnets are hard (the magnets do not vary in strength with external fields). However, Earnshaw's theorem does not necessarily apply to moving ferromagnets, certain electromagnetic systems, pseudo-levitation and diamagnetic materials. This led J. J. Thomson in 1904 to his plum pudding model, where the negative point charges (electrons, or ""plums"") are embedded into a distributed positive charge ""pudding"", where they could be either stationary or moving along circles; this is a configuration which is non-point positive charges (and also non-stationary negative charges), not covered by Earnshaw's theorem.

In radiometry, radiosity is the radiant flux leaving (emitted, reflected and transmitted by) a surface per unit area, and spectral radiosity is the radiosity of a surface per unit frequency or wavelength, depending on whether the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. Radiosity may refer to: *Radiosity (radiometry), the total radiation (emitted plus reflected) leaving a surface, certainly including the reflected radiation and the emitted radiation. In radiometry, radiance is the radiant flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received by a given surface, per unit solid angle per unit projected area. In radiometry, irradiance is the radiant flux received by a surface per unit area. Radiosity is often called in branches of physics other than radiometry, but in radiometry this usage leads to confusion with radiant intensity. ==Mathematical definitions== ===Radiosity=== Radiosity of a surface, denoted Je (""e"" for ""energetic"", to avoid confusion with photometric quantities), is defined as :J_\mathrm{e} = \frac{\partial \Phi_\mathrm{e}}{\partial A} = J_\mathrm{e,em} + J_\mathrm{e,r} + J_\mathrm{e,tr}, where * ∂ is the partial derivative symbol * \Phi_e is the radiant flux leaving (emitted, reflected and transmitted) * A is the area * J_{e,em} = M_e is the emitted component of the radiosity of the surface, that is to say its exitance * J_{e,r} is the reflected component of the radiosity of the surface * J_{e,tr} is the transmitted component of the radiosity of the surface For an opaque surface, the transmitted component of radiosity Je,tr vanishes and only two components remain: :J_\mathrm{e} = M_\mathrm{e} + J_\mathrm{e,r}. Radiodensity (or radiopacity) is opacity to the radio wave and X-ray portion of the electromagnetic spectrum: that is, the relative inability of those kinds of electromagnetic radiation to pass through a particular material.

Virtual photons are referred to as ""virtual"" because they do not exist as free particles in the traditional sense but instead serve as intermediate particles in the exchange of force between other particles. The virtual particles, also known as force carriers, are bosons, with different bosons associated with each force. Virtual photons are said to be ""off-shell"", which means that they do not obey the usual relationship between energy and momentum that applies to real particles. In particle physics, V was a generic name for heavy, unstable subatomic particles that decay into a pair of particles, thereby producing a characteristic letter V in a bubble chamber or other particle detector. Virtual photons are a fundamental concept in particle physics and quantum field theory that play a crucial role in describing the interactions between electrically charged particles. Virtual photons are thought of as fluctuations in the electromagnetic field, characterized by their energy, momentum, and polarization.

The Art of Noises is considered by some authors to be one of the most important and influential texts in 20th-century musical aesthetics. ==The evolution of sound== Russolo's essay explores the origins of man made sounds. ===Ancient life was all silence=== Russolo states that ""noise"" first came into existence as the result of 19th century machines. The Art of Noises () is a Futurist manifesto written by Luigi Russolo in a 1913 letter to friend and Futurist composer Francesco Balilla Pratella. With the exception of storms, waterfalls, and tectonic activity, the noise that did punctuate this silence were not loud, prolonged, or varied. ===Early sounds=== He notes that the earliest ""music"" was very simplistic and was created with very simple instruments, and that many early civilizations considered the secrets of music sacred and reserved it for rites and rituals.

Conversely, glancing toward the sun, the colors that were not scattered away—the longer wavelengths such as red and yellow light—are directly visible, giving the sun itself a slightly yellowish hue. Rayleigh scattering of sunlight in Earth's atmosphere causes diffuse sky radiation, which is the reason for the blue color of the daytime and twilight sky, as well as the yellowish to reddish hue of the low Sun. Sunlight is also subject to Raman scattering, which changes the rotational state of the molecules and gives rise to polarization effects. Roughly speaking, the red light from the Sun is blocked by Earth, the blue light is scattered by the atmosphere, and the green light is refracted by the atmosphere to the observer. right|thumb|The green blobs are false-color images of (non-green) stars. Furthermore, the Sun emits more green photons than any other color; i.e. it peaks in the green part of the visible spectrum. ===False color images=== Astronomical images are sometimes printed in false colors, which can make stars look green. ==See also== *Spectral classification == References == ==Sources== * ==External links== * Category:Stars Category:Optical illusions However, stars whose peak emission is green light (around 6000K, similar to the Sun) also emit a great deal of both red and blue light, and the human visual system interprets this mixture of colors as whitish rather than green. On Earth, sunlight is scattered and filtered through Earth's atmosphere, and is obvious as daylight when the Sun is above the horizon. 

<<Question:>>
What is the reason for the sun appearing slightly yellowish when viewed from Earth?

<<Options:>>
A, The sun appears yellowish due to a reflection of the Earth's atmosphere.
B, The longer wavelengths of light, such as red and yellow, are not scattered away and are directly visible when looking towards the sun.
C, The sun appears yellowish due to the scattering of all colors of light, mainly blue and green, in the Earth's atmosphere.
D, The sun emits a yellow light due to its own spectrum, which is visible when viewed from Earth.
E, The atmosphere absorbs the shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and red, leaving only the longer wavelengths of light, such as green and yellow, visible when looking towards the sun.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

In physics, the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation, named for Lev Landau, Evgeny Lifshitz, and T. L. Gilbert, is a name used for a differential equation describing the precessional motion of magnetization in a solid. By way of the micromagnetic theory,R. M. White, Quantum Theory of Magnetism: Magnetic Properties of Materials (3rd Ed.), Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 2007. the Landau-Lifshitz- Gilbert equation also applies to the mesoscopic- and macroscopic-scale magnetization M of a sample by simple substitution, :\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{M}}{\mathrm{d}t}=-\gamma \mu_0 \mathbf{M} \times \mathbf{H_{eff}} + \frac{\alpha}{M} \left( \mathbf{M} \times \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{M}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right). == References == Category:Magnetism The Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation predicts the rotation of the magnetization in response to torques. Using the methods of irreversible statistical mechanics, numerous authors have independently obtained the Landau–Lifshitz equation. ==Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation== In 1955 Gilbert replaced the damping term in the Landau–Lifshitz (LL) equation by one that depends on the time derivative of the magnetization: {d t}=-\gamma \left(\mathbf{M} \times \mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{eff}} - \eta \mathbf{M}\times\frac{d \mathbf{M}}{d t}\right)|}} This is the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert (LLG) equation, where is the damping parameter, which is characteristic of the material. The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation can also be written in terms of torques, :\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{m}}{\mathrm{d}t}=-\gamma \left( \boldsymbol{\tau} + \boldsymbol{\tau_{d}} \right), where the damping torque is given by :\boldsymbol{\tau_{d}}=-\frac{\alpha}{\gamma m} \left( \mathbf{m} \times \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{m}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right). In solid-state physics, the Landau–Lifshitz equation (LLE), named for Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, is a partial differential equation describing time evolution of magnetism in solids, depending on 1 time variable and 1, 2, or 3 space variables. ==Landau–Lifshitz equation== The LLE describes an anisotropic magnet.

In the physics of continuous media, spatial dispersion is a phenomenon where material parameters such as permittivity or conductivity have dependence on wavevector. Spatial dispersion refers to the non-local response of the medium to the space; this can be reworded as the wavevector dependence of the permittivity. Spatial dispersion can be compared to temporal dispersion, the latter often just called dispersion. Within optics, dispersion is a property of telecommunication signals along transmission lines (such as microwaves in coaxial cable) or the pulses of light in optical fiber. Temporal dispersion represents memory effects in systems, commonly seen in optics and electronics. In optics and in wave propagation in general, dispersion is the phenomenon in which the phase velocity of a wave depends on its frequency; sometimes the term chromatic dispersion is used for specificity to optics in particular.

Cold Dark Matter may refer to: * Cold dark matter, a hypothetical form of dark matter in cosmology and physics * Cold Dark Matter (Psychic TV album) * Cold Dark Matter (Red Harvest album), 2000 The primary candidate for dark matter is some new kind of elementary particle that has not yet been discovered, such as weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or axions. Dark matter is thought to be non-baryonic; it may be composed of some as-yet-undiscovered subatomic particles.A small portion of dark matter could be baryonic and/or neutrinos. This form of dark matter is composed of ""baryons"", heavy subatomic particles such as protons and neutrons and combinations of these, including non-emitting ordinary atoms. ==Presence== Baryonic dark matter may occur in non-luminous gas or in Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) – condensed objects such as black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, very faint stars, or non-luminous objects like planets and brown dwarfs. ==Estimates of quantity== The total amount of baryonic dark matter can be inferred from models of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and observations of the cosmic microwave background.

Nano-FTIR (nanoscale Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) is a scanning probe technique that utilizes as a combination of two techniques: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a technique used to obtain an infrared spectrum of absorption or emission of a solid, liquid, or gas. A typical nano-FTIR setup thus consists of an atomic force microscope, a broadband infrared light source used for tip illumination, and a Michelson interferometer acting as Fourier-transform spectrometer. A mathematical approach Fourier Transform converts the raw data into spectrum. === Advantages === * The FTIR technique uses a polychromatic beam of light with a wide range of continuous frequencies simultaneously, and therefore allows a much higher speed of scanning versus the conventional monochromatic dispersive spectroscopy. As s-SNOM, nano-FTIR is based on atomic-force microscopy (AFM), where a sharp tip is illuminated by an external light source and the tip- scattered light (typically back-scattered) is detected as a function of tip position. The diffuse radiation is then focused again on a mirror when they exit and the combined IR beam carries the bulk sample information to the detector. 320px|DRIFT Spectroscopy Reflection- absorption FTIR * Sample is usually prepared as a thick block and is polished into a smooth surface.

In magnetic materials, the cause of the magnetic moment are the spin and orbital angular momentum states of the electrons, and varies depending on whether atoms in one region are aligned with atoms in another. === Magnetic pole model === thumb|upright|An electrostatic analog for a magnetic moment: two opposing charges separated by a finite distance. These unpaired dipoles (often called simply ""spins"", even though they also generally include orbital angular momentum) tend to align in parallel to an external magnetic field leading to a macroscopic effect called paramagnetism. This dipole moment comes from the more fundamental property of the electron that it has quantum mechanical spin. In atomic physics, the electron magnetic moment, or more specifically the electron magnetic dipole moment, is the magnetic moment of an electron resulting from its intrinsic properties of spin and electric charge. A magnetic dipole moment can be generated by two possible mechanisms. The origin of the magnetic moments responsible for magnetization can be either microscopic electric currents resulting from the motion of electrons in atoms, or the spin of the electrons or the nuclei. 

<<Question:>>
What is the origin of the permanent moment in paramagnetism?

<<Options:>>
A, The permanent moment is generally due to the spin of unpaired electrons in atomic or molecular electron orbitals.
B, The permanent moment is due to the alignment of dipoles perpendicular to the applied field.
C, The permanent moment is due to the torque provided on the magnetic moments by an applied field, which tries to align the dipoles perpendicular to the applied field.
D, The permanent moment is due to the quantum-mechanical properties of spin and angular momentum.

Classical Newtonian physics has, formally, been replaced by quantum mechanics on the small scale and relativity on the large scale. From this textual evolution, it appears that Newton wanted by the later headings ""Rules"" and ""Phenomena"" to clarify for his readers his view of the roles to be played by these various statements. The successes of kinetic theory gave further credence to the idea that matter is composed of atoms, yet the theory also had shortcomings that would only be resolved by the development of quantum mechanics. The idea that macroscopic objects may follow the laws of quantum mechanics dates back to the advent of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century.. Often the term Newtonian dynamics is narrowed to Newton's second law \displaystyle m\,\mathbf a=\mathbf F. ==Newton's second law in a multidimensional space== Consider \displaystyle N particles with masses \displaystyle m_1,\,\ldots,\,m_N in the regular three-dimensional Euclidean space. With the publication of his Principia roughly eighty years later (1687), Isaac Newton provided a physical theory that accounted for all three of Kepler's laws, a theory based on Newton's laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation.

In the book entitled The Essence of Chaos published in 1993, Lorenz defined butterfly effect as: ""The phenomenon that a small alteration in the state of a dynamical system will cause subsequent states to differ greatly from the states that would have followed without the alteration."" In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. The butterfly effect describes a phenomenon in chaos theory whereby a minor change in circumstances can cause a large change in outcome. In popular media the ""butterfly effect"" stems from the real-world implications of the Lorenz attractor, namely that several different initial chaotic conditions evolve in phase space in a way that never repeats, so all chaos is unpredictable. While the ""butterfly effect"" is often explained as being synonymous with sensitive dependence on initial conditions of the kind described by Lorenz in his 1963 paper (and previously observed by Poincaré), the butterfly metaphor was originally applied to work he published in 1969 which took the idea a step further. A short documentary that explains the ""butterfly effect"" in context of Lorenz's work. 

<<Question:>>
What is the butterfly effect, as defined by Lorenz in his book ""The Essence of Chaos""?

<<Options:>>
A, The butterfly effect is the phenomenon that a small change in the initial conditions of a dynamical system can cause subsequent states to differ greatly from the states that would have followed without the alteration, as defined by Einstein in his book ""The Theory of Relativity.""
B, The butterfly effect is the phenomenon that a large change in the initial conditions of a dynamical system has no effect on subsequent states, as defined by Lorenz in his book ""The Essence of Chaos.""
C, The butterfly effect is the phenomenon that a small change in the initial conditions of a dynamical system can cause significant differences in subsequent states, as defined by Lorenz in his book ""The Essence of Chaos.""
D, The butterfly effect is the phenomenon that a small change in the initial conditions of a dynamical system has no effect on subsequent states, as defined by Lorenz in his book ""The Essence of Chaos.""

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

It interacts with the other genes of the ABC model of flower development in a variety of ways. == Gene function == Superman encodes a transcription factor. One of the most studied examples is the cortical rotation during Xenopus development, where this rotation acts as the symmetry-breaking event that determines the dorsal- ventral axis of the developing embryo. Nearly all are bilaterally symmetrical as adults as well; the most notable exception is the echinoderms, which achieve secondary pentaradial symmetry as adults, but are bilaterally symmetrical during embryonic development. Homologous genes are known in the petunia and snapdragon,Box 3: The control of floral determinacy in Antirrhinum and Arabidopsis from which are also involved in flower development, although in both cases there are important differences from the functioning in Arabidopsis. The PAR protein network works under similar mechanisms, where the certain PAR proteins, which are initially homogenous throughout the cell, break their symmetry and are segregated to different ends of the zygote to establish a polarity during development. ==Cortical rotation== Cortical rotation is a phenomenon that seems to be limited to Xenopus and few ancient teleosts, however the underlying mechanisms of cortical rotation have conserved elements that are found in other chordates. When found in brachiopods and molluscs, these genes are asymmetrically expressed on the right. 

<<Question:>>
What is the role of CYCLOIDEA genes in the evolution of bilateral symmetry?

<<Options:>>
A, CYCLOIDEA genes are responsible for the selection of symmetry in the evolution of animals.
B, CYCLOIDEA genes are responsible for the evolution of specialized pollinators in plants, which in turn led to the transition of radially symmetrical flowers to bilaterally symmetrical flowers.
C, CYCLOIDEA genes are responsible for the expression of dorsal petals in Antirrhinum majus, which control their size and shape.
D, CYCLOIDEA genes are responsible for the expression of transcription factors that control the expression of other genes, allowing their expression to influence developmental pathways relating to symmetry.
E, CYCLOIDEA genes are responsible for mutations that cause a reversion to radial symmetry.

This strongly suggested that there must also be a sixth quark, the top, to complete the pair. They may consist of five quarks tightly bound together, but it is also possible that they are more loosely bound and consist of a three-quark baryon and a two- quark meson interacting relatively weakly with each other via pion exchange (the same force that binds atomic nuclei) in a ""meson-baryon molecule"". ==History== ===Mid-2000s=== The requirement to include an antiquark means that many classes of pentaquark are hard to identify experimentally – if the flavour of the antiquark matches the flavour of any other quark in the quintuplet, it will cancel out and the particle will resemble its three-quark hadron cousin. All quarks are assigned a baryon number of ⅓. An example would be pentaquarks, consisting of four quarks and one antiquark (qqqqq̅). During the quark epoch, the universe was filled with a dense, hot quark–gluon plasma, containing quarks, leptons and their antiparticles.

The Droste effect (), known in art as an example of mise en abyme, is the effect of a picture recursively appearing within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear. The illustration reappears on the cocoa package held by the nurse, inducing a recursive visual effect known today as the Droste effect.Törnqvist, Egil. They devised a method of filling in the artwork's central void in an additional application of the Droste effect by successively rotating and shrinking an image of the artwork. === Advertising === In the 20th century, the Droste effect was used to market a variety of products. The effect has been a motif, too, for the cover of many comic books, where it was especially popular in the 1940s. == Effect == === Origins === The Droste effect is named after the image on the tins and boxes of Droste cocoa powder which displayed a nurse carrying a serving tray with a cup of hot chocolate and a box with the same image, designed by Jan Misset.""Bedenker van Droste-effect bekend"", Trouw, 1 August 1994.

In French and Italian, the terms for ""water hammer"" come from the hydraulic ram: coup de bélier (French) and colpo d'ariete (Italian) both mean ""blow of the ram"". see page 22. Other potential causes of water hammer: * A pump stopping * A check valve which closes quickly (i.e., ""check valve slam"") due to the flow in a pipe reversing direction on loss of motive power, such as a pump stopping. The following characteristics may reduce or eliminate water hammer: * Reduce the pressure of the water supply to the building by fitting a regulator. In residential plumbing systems, water hammer may occur when a dishwasher, washing machine or toilet suddenly shuts off water flow. Hydraulic hammer may refer to: *Breaker (hydraulic), a percussion hammer fitted to an excavator for demolishing concrete structures or rocks *Hydraulic hammer, a type of piling hammer As a result, we see that we can reduce the water hammer by: * increasing the pipe diameter at constant flow, which reduces the flow velocity and hence the deceleration of the liquid column; * employing the solid material as tight as possible with respect to the internal fluid bulk (solid Young modulus low with respect to fluid bulk modulus); * introducing a device that increases the flexibility of the entire hydraulic system, such as a hydraulic accumulator; * where possible, increasing the fraction of undissolved gases in the liquid. ==Dynamic equations== The water hammer effect can be simulated by solving the following partial differential equations. : \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{B} \frac{dP}{dt} = 0, : \frac{dV}{dt} + \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial P}{\partial x} + \frac{f}{2D} V |V| = 0, where V is the fluid velocity inside pipe, \rho is the fluid density, B is the equivalent bulk modulus, and f is the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor. ==Column separation== Column separation is a phenomenon that can occur during a water- hammer event.

These defects are essential for the defect drift-dominated resistive switching memory. However, due to process and material variations, an array of memory cells has a distribution of switching fields with a deviation σ. The retention, therefore, degrades exponentially with reduced write current. ===Speed=== Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) performance is limited by the rate at which the charge stored in the cells can be drained (for reading) or stored (for writing). This is in contrast to dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and static random-access memory (SRAM), which both maintain data only for as long as power is applied, or forms of sequential-access memory such as magnetic tape, which cannot be randomly accessed but which retains data indefinitely without electric power. Current existing types of semiconductor non-volatile memory have limitations in memory size, power consumption, or operating life that make them impractical for main memory.

C, The memory device is found to be in a distinct resistance state {j}, and there exists no physical one-to-one relationship between its present state and its foregoing voltage history.
D, The device is subjected to biases below the threshold value, which still allows for a finite probability of switching, but it is possible to predict when it will occur.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

The internal energy of an isolated system cannot change, as expressed in the law of conservation of energy, a foundation of the first law of thermodynamics. Based on many observations, thermodynamics postulates that all systems that are isolated from the external environment will evolve so as to approach unique stable equilibrium states. It is, however, the fruit of experience that some physical systems, including isolated ones, do seem to reach their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. It is an axiom of thermodynamics that an isolated system eventually reaches internal thermodynamic equilibrium, when its state no longer changes with time. For a cycle for which the system returns to its initial state the first law of thermodynamics applies: :\Delta U = E_{in} - E_{out} = 0 The above states that there is no change of the internal energy (U) of the system over the cycle. For example, for a closed system of interest, a change of internal energy (an extensive state variable of the system) can be occasioned by transfer of energy as heat. 

<<Question:>>
What happens to an initially inhomogeneous physical system that is isolated by a thermodynamic operation?

<<Options:>>
A, It will change its internal state only if it is composed of a single subsystem and has internal walls.
B, It will change its internal state only if it is composed of several subsystems separated from each other by walls.
C, It will remain in its initial state indefinitely.
D, It will generally change its internal state over time.

In physics, the relativity of simultaneity is the concept that distant simultaneity – whether two spatially separated events occur at the same time – is not absolute, but depends on the observer's reference frame. Simultaneity may refer to: * Relativity of simultaneity, a concept in special relativity. Some of these are: * Relativity of simultaneity: Two events, simultaneous for one observer, may not be simultaneous for another observer if the observers are in relative motion. However, this paper does not contain any discussion of Lorentz's theory or the possible difference in defining simultaneity for observers in different states of motion. This relativity of simultaneity means that switching from one inertial frame to another requires an adjustment in what slice through spacetime counts as the ""present"".

SQUIDs, or superconducting quantum interference devices, are very sensitive magnetometers that operate via the Josephson effect. Josephson effect has also been observed in superfluid helium quantum interference devices (SHeQUIDs), the superfluid helium analog of a dc-SQUID.Physics Today, Superfluid helium interferometers, Y. Sato and R. Packard, October 2012, page 31 ==The Josephson equations== thumb|Diagram of a single Josephson junction. Also see Donald G. McDonald, ""History of the Josephson Effect"" (lecture), IEEE.TV. Whitaker writes that the discovery of the Josephson effect led to ""much important physics,"" including the invention of SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices), which are used in geology to make highly sensitive measurements, as well as in medicine and computing.Whitaker 2012, pp. 273–274. Josephson junctions have important applications in quantum-mechanical circuits, such as SQUIDs, superconducting qubits, and RSFQ digital electronics. In physics, the Josephson effect is a phenomenon that occurs when two superconductors are placed in proximity, with some barrier or restriction between them. A SQUID consists of two Josephson tunnel junctions that are connected together in a superconducting loop (see Figure 1).

Crystallinity can be measured using x-ray crystallography, but calorimetric techniques are also commonly used. == Rock crystallinity == Geologists describe four qualitative levels of crystallinity: * holocrystalline rocks are completely crystalline; * hypocrystalline rocks are partially crystalline, with crystals embedded in an amorphous or glassy matrix; * hypohyaline rocks are partially glassy; * holohyaline rocks (such as obsidian) are completely glassy. ==References== Oxford dictionary of science, 1999, . Crystallinity refers to the degree of structural order in a solid. Determining the ""illite crystallinity index"" allows geologists to designate what metamorphic facies and metamorphic zone the rock was formed in and to infer what temperature the rock was formed. In such cases, crystallinity is usually specified as a percentage of the volume of the material that is crystalline. A Century of Progress in Crystallography, The American Mineralogist, 19, 93-100 Category:Crystallography Category:Physics timelines The inclusions in the crystals (both solid and fluid) are of great interest; one mineral may enclose another, or may contain spaces occupied by glass, by fluids or by gases. ==Microstructure== The structure of the rock - the relation of its components to one another - is usually clearly indicated, whether it is fragmented or massive; the presence of glassy matter in contradistinction to a completely crystalline or ""holo-crystalline"" condition; the nature and origin of organic fragments; banding, foliation or lamination; the pumiceous or porous structure of many lavas.

That is, a parameter is an element of a system that is useful, or critical, when identifying the system, or when evaluating its performance, status, condition, etc. Parameter has more specific meanings within various disciplines, including mathematics, computer programming, engineering, statistics, logic, linguistics, and electronic musical composition. A parameter (), generally, is any characteristic that can help in defining or classifying a particular system (meaning an event, project, object, situation, etc.). In quantum field theory, an order operator or an order field is a quantum field version of Landau's order parameter whose expectation value characterizes phase transitions. These concepts play an important role in many applications of order theory. In some informal situations it is a matter of convention (or historical accident) whether some or all of the symbols in a function definition are called parameters. The notion of order is very general, extending beyond contexts that have an immediate, intuitive feel of sequence or relative quantity. 

<<Question:>>

<<Options:>>
A, An order parameter is a measure of the temperature of a physical system.
B, An order parameter is a measure of the gravitational force in a physical system.

Their discovery was confirmed by Nather, Warner, and Macfarlane. thumb|left|Light curve and slow motion picture of the pulsar located in the center of the Crab Nebula. The Crab Pulsar (PSR B0531+21) is a relatively young neutron star. However, the discovery of a pulsating radio source in the centre of the Crab Nebula was strong evidence that pulsars were formed by supernova explosions. The discovery of the Crab Pulsar, and the knowledge of its exact age (almost to the day) allows for the verification of basic physical properties of these objects, such as characteristic age and spin-down luminosity, the orders of magnitude involved (notably the strength of the magnetic field), along with various aspects related to the dynamics of the remnant. The Crab Pulsar itself was discovered in 1968 by Dr Susan Jocelyn Bell. A significant problem in studies of the Crab Nebula is that the combined mass of the nebula and the pulsar add up to considerably less than the predicted mass of the progenitor star, and the question of where the 'missing mass' is, remains unresolved.

This behaviour is known as the De Haas–Van Alphen effect and relates the period of the susceptibility with the Fermi surface of the material. The De Haas–Van Alphen effect, often abbreviated to DHVA, is a quantum mechanical effect in which the magnetic susceptibility of a pure metal crystal oscillates as the intensity of the magnetic field B is increased. In a quantum oscillation experiment, the external magnetic field is varied, which causes the Landau levels to pass over the Fermi surface, which in turn results in oscillations of the electronic density of states at the Fermi level; this produces oscillations in the many material properties which depend on this, including resistance (the Shubnikov–de Haas effect), Hall resistance, and magnetic susceptibility (the de Haas–van Alphen effect). Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations can be used to map the Fermi surface of electrons in a sample, by determining the periods of oscillation for various applied field directions. == Related physical process == The effect is related to the De Haas–Van Alphen effect, which is the name given to the corresponding oscillations in magnetization. These experimental results thus disagree with those from ARPES and other probes. ==See also== * de Haas–van Alphen effect * Shubnikov–de Haas effect * Landau levels ==References== Category:Condensed matter physics Category:Experimental physics Category:Magnetism ""On the theory of the De Haas–Van Alphen effect for particles with an arbitrary dispersion law.""

The phenomenon is named for the characteristic ring-like deposit along the perimeter of a spill of coffee. Mixtures of low boiling point and high boiling point solvents were shown to suppress the coffee ring effect, changing the shape of a deposited solute from a ring-like to a dot-like shape. thumb|Stains produced by the evaporation of coffee spills In physics, a ""coffee ring"" is a pattern left by a puddle of particle-laden liquid after it evaporates.

Probability amplitudes provide a relationship between the quantum state vector of a system and the results of observations of that system, a link was first proposed by Max Born, in 1926. In quantum physics, the scattering amplitude is the probability amplitude of the outgoing spherical wave relative to the incoming plane wave in a stationary-state scattering process.Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications By Nouredine Zettili, 2nd edition, page 623.

Loudness is related to amplitude and intensity and is one of the most salient qualities of a sound, although in general sounds it can be recognized independently of amplitude. The amplitude of sound waves and audio signals (which relates to the volume) conventionally refers to the amplitude of the air pressure in the wave, but sometimes the amplitude of the displacement (movements of the air or the diaphragm of a speaker) is described. Loudness, a subjective measure, is often confused with physical measures of sound strength such as sound pressure, sound pressure level (in decibels), sound intensity or sound power. The relation of physical attributes of sound to perceived loudness consists of physical, physiological and psychological components. The sound intensity is the product of sound pressure and particle velocity. A more complex signal also creates more nerve firings and so sounds louder (for the same wave amplitude) than a simpler sound, such as a sine wave. ===Timbre=== thumb|Figure 4.

By defining and identifying coherent structure in this manner, turbulent flows can be decomposed into coherent structures and incoherent structures depending on their coherence, particularly their correlations with their vorticity. Turbulent flows are complex multi-scale and chaotic motions that need to be classified into more elementary components, referred to coherent turbulent structures. Hence, similarly organized events in an ensemble average of organized events can be defined as a coherent structure, and whatever events not identified as similar or phase and space aligned in the ensemble average is an incoherent turbulent structure. Other attempts at defining a coherent structure can be done through examining the correlation between their momenta or pressure and their turbulent flows. Furthermore, a coherent structure is defined as a turbulent flow whose vorticity expression, which is usually stochastic, contains orderly components that can be described as being instantaneously coherent over the spatial extent of the flow structure. Such a structure must have temporal coherence, i.e. it must persist in its form for long enough periods that the methods of time-averaged statistics can be applied.

The occurrence of each type of supernova depends on the progenitor star's metallicity, since this affects the strength of the stellar wind and thereby the rate at which the star loses mass. Average characteristics vary somewhat with distance and type of host galaxy, but can broadly be specified for each supernova type. A supernova is first categorized as either a Type I or Type II, then subcategorized based on more specific traits. This is because typical type Ia supernovae arise from a consistent type of progenitor star by gradual mass acquisition, and explode when they acquire a consistent typical mass, giving rise to very similar supernova conditions and behaviour. Type Ic supernovae have been observed to occur in regions that are more metal-rich and have higher star-formation rates than average for their host galaxies. Stars with an initial mass up to about 90 times the sun, or a little less at high metallicity, result in a type II-P supernova, which is the most commonly observed type. 

<<Question:>>
What is the main factor that determines the occurrence of each type of supernova?

<<Options:>>
A, The star's distance from Earth
B, The star's age
C, The star's temperature

Emissivity and emittivity are both dimensionless quantities given in the range of 0 to 1, representing the comparative/relative emittance with respect to a blackbody operating in similar conditions, but emissivity refers to a material property (of a homogeneous material), while emittivity refers to specific samples or objects. Low emissivity (low e or low thermal emissivity) refers to a surface condition that emits low levels of radiant thermal (heat) energy. Emissivity of a body at a given temperature is the ratio of the total emissive power of a body to the total emissive power of a perfectly black body at that temperature. The emissivity of the surface of a material is its effectiveness in emitting energy as thermal radiation. The term emissivity is generally used to describe a simple, homogeneous surface such as silver. Emissivity measurements for many surfaces are compiled in many handbooks and texts. 

<<Question:>>
What is emissivity?

<<Options:>>
A, Emissivity is a measure of how well a surface resists deformation under stress.
B, Emissivity is a measure of how well a surface conducts heat.

This is the earliest description of pulmonary circulation. === Pulmonary circulation === The most commonly accepted theory of cardiac function prior to Ibn al-Nafis was that of Galen. Both theories attempt to explain circulation. 2nd century Greek physician Galen's theory about the physiology of the circulatory system remained unchallenged until the works of Ibn al-Nafis, for which he has been described as ""the father of circulatory physiology"". The Greek physician Galen (129 – c. 210 CE) provided the next insights into pulmonary circulation. Several figures such as Hippocrates and al-Nafis receive credit for accurately predicting or developing specific elements of the modern model of pulmonary circulation: Hippocrates for being the first to describe pulmonary circulation as a discrete system separable from systemic circulation as a whole and al-Nafis for making great strides over the understanding of those before him and towards a rigorous model. In the “Commentary of the anatomy of the Canon of Avicenna”, human anatomy experts such as Patrice Le Floch-Prigent and Dominique Delaval, concluded that Ibn al-Nafis used clinical, physiological, and dissection results in discovering and describing the pulmonary heart circulation in humans. Greek physician Erasistratus (315 – 240 BCE) agreed with Hippocrates and Aristotle that the heart was the origin of all of the vessels in the body but proposed a system in which air was drawn into the lungs and traveled to the left ventricle via pulmonary veins.

Mammals are characterized by the presence of milk-producing mammary glands for feeding their young, a neocortex region of the brain, fur or hair, and three middle ear bones. The mammary glands of mammals are specialized to produce milk, the primary source of nutrition for newborns. A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in humans and other mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, sheep, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). The number and positioning of mammary glands varies widely in different mammals. These mammary glands are modified sweat glands. == Structure== The basic components of a mature mammary gland are the alveoli (hollow cavities, a few millimeters large), which are lined with milk-secreting cuboidal cells and surrounded by myoepithelial cells.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

Scientists think that other comets are chemically similar to Halley's Comet. So the comets in this model would have a different composition than those comets that were made directly from interstellar ice. Instead, comets are predominantly organic materials and minerals. Her work found connections between the makeup of comets and of the interstellar medium, and with prebiotic chemistry. For example, the isotopic ratios of comet and of interstellar dust are very similar, indicating a common origin. Research conducted in 2014 suggests that comets are like ""deep fried ice cream"", in that their surfaces are formed of dense crystalline ice mixed with organic compounds, while the interior ice is colder and less dense. 

<<Question:>>
What is the relationship between interstellar and cometary chemistry?

<<Options:>>
A, Cometary chemistry is responsible for the formation of interstellar molecules, but there is no direct connection between the two.
B, Interstellar and cometary chemistry are the same thing, just with different names.
C, There is a possible connection between interstellar and cometary chemistry, as indicated by the similarity between interstellar and cometary ices and the analysis of organics from comet samples returned by the Stardust mission.
D, There is no relationship between interstellar and cometary chemistry, as they are two completely different phenomena.

Recycling is an important part of creating more sustainable economies, reducing the cost and environmental impact of raw materials. Recycling of metals varies extremely by type. However, the report found that less than a third of the crucial 60 metals studied in the report have an end- of-life recycling rate above 50 per cent, and 34 of them have a recycling rate of below 1 per cent.Clean technologies under threat from low metals reuse Environmental Data Interactive Exchange downloaded 22 September 2011 Green technologies would certainly benefit from greater metals recycling. Recycling Rates of Metals: A Status Report was the 2nd of six scientific assessments on global metals to be published by the International Resource Panel (IRP) of the United Nations Environment Programme. Most of the remaining metals have recycling rates of below 35%, while 34 types of metals have recycling rates of under 1%. The best recycling can do is to delay; complete closure of material loops to achieve 100 percent recycling of nonrenewables is impossible as micro-trace materials dissipate into the environment causing severe damage to the planet's ecosystems.

Methane is also a side product of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide in the Fischer–Tropsch process, which is practiced on a large scale to produce longer-chain molecules than methane. The Fischer–Tropsch process is a collection of chemical reactions that converts a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, known as syngas, into liquid hydrocarbons. Most important is the water-gas shift reaction, which provides a source of hydrogen at the expense of carbon monoxide: :H2O + CO -> H2 + CO2 For FT plants that use methane as the feedstock, another important reaction is dry reforming, which converts the methane into CO and H2: : CH4 + CO2 -> 2CO + 2H2 ===Process conditions=== Generally, the Fischer–Tropsch process is operated in the temperature range of . Fischer-Tropsch process is discussed as a step of producing carbon-neutral liquid hydrocarbon fuels from CO2 and hydrogen.Davis, S.J., Lewis, N.S., Shaner, M., Aggarwal, S., Arent, D., Azevedo, I.L., Benson, S.M., Bradley, T., Brouwer, J., Chiang, Y.M. and Clack, C.T., 2018. Thus, the gas requires significant refining before being used in the Fischer–Tropsch reaction. Gas pipelines distribute large amounts of natural gas, of which methane is the principal component. ===Fuel=== Methane is used as a fuel for ovens, homes, water heaters, kilns, automobiles, turbines, etc.

An ecological pyramid (also trophic pyramid, Eltonian pyramid, energy pyramid, or sometimes food pyramid) is a graphical representation designed to show the biomass or bioproductivity at each trophic level in an ecosystem. A pyramid of biomass shows the relationship between biomass and trophic level by quantifying the biomass present at each trophic level of an ecological community at a particular time. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated. === Trophic levels === A trophic level (from Greek troph, τροφή, trophē, meaning ""food"" or ""feeding"") is ""a group of organisms acquiring a considerable majority of its energy from the lower adjacent level (according to ecological pyramids) nearer the abiotic source."" Trophic levels are part of the holistic or complex systems view of ecosystems. Energy pyramids are necessarily upright in healthy ecosystems, that is, there must always be more energy available at a given level of the pyramid to support the energy and biomass requirement of the next trophic level. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative to the importance of their role.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and

In chemistry, a crossover experiment is a method used to study the mechanism of a chemical reaction. The aim of a crossover experiment is to determine whether or not a reaction process involves a stage where the components of each reactant have an opportunity to exchange with each other. Crossover designs are common for experiments in many scientific disciplines, for example psychology, pharmaceutical science, and medicine. However, in some cases a crossover experiment alone will be able to distinguish between the main possibilities, for example in the case of intramolecular vs. intermolecular organic reaction mechanisms. In practice, crossover experiments aim to use the least change possible between the usual conditions of the reaction being studied and the conditions of the crossover experiment. Crossover experiments. 

<<Question:>>

Tolerogenic DCs also produce different cytokines as mature DCs (e.g. anti- inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-10, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)). Repetitive stimulation of T cells by iDCs can convert them into Tregs Immature and semimature dendritic cells are tolerogenic under steady-state conditions and once exposed to pro-inflammatory milieu they can also become immunogenic. === Induced tolerogenic dendritic cells === Tol-DCs can be induced by chemicals, pathological conditions or molecular modifications. ==== Pathogen-induced tolerogenic DC ==== Certain pathogens are capable of hijacking host immune tolerance and induce Tregs in their surroundings. ==== Tumour-induced tolerogenic DC ==== Tumours also developed ways of inducing tol-DCs resulting in differentiation and accumulation of Tregs in their stroma and draining lymph node. ==== Pharmacologically-induced tolerogenic DCs ==== As already mentioned above many pharmacological substances are capable of inducing tol- DCs including corticosteroids, rapamycin, cyclosporine, tacrolism, aspirin,. ==== Genetically-induced tolerogenic DCs ==== Genetic manipulations can used to confer tolerogenic properties on DCs such as gene knock down, knock-out, transgenic over expression of proteins and others. == References == Category:Immunology Category:Immune system Category:Cell biology These tolerogenic properties are executed by deletion of T cells, induction of Tregs and anergized T cells, then by expression of immunomodulatory molecules such as PD-L1 and PD-L2, heme oxygenase 1, HLA-G, CD95L, TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligands, galectin-1 and DC-SIGN and production of immunosuppressive molecules such as IL-10, TGF-b, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), IL-27 and NO. == Cytokines and molecules in differentiation of tol-DCs == Tol-DCs can be induced by various stimuli. In addition, incubation with inhibitory cytokines IL-10 or TGF-β leads to generation of tolerogenic phenotype. IL-10 is capable of inhibiting synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-3, TNFα and GM-CSF made by cells such as macrophages and Th1 T cells. The protective and non-pathogenic Th17 cells induced by IL-6 and TGF-β are termed as Treg17 cells. 

<<Question:>>
What is the role of IL-10 in the formation of Tr1 cells and tolerogenic DCs?

<<Options:>>
A, IL-10 inhibits the formation of Tr1 cells and tolerogenic DCs, which are dependent on TGF-β and Tregs. Tr1 cells produce low levels of IL-10 and TGF-β, while tolerogenic DCs produce TGF-β that is important for Tr1 formation.
B, IL-10 induces the formation of Tr1 cells and tolerogenic DCs, which are dependent on IL-10 and TGF-β, but differ from Tregs by lacking expression of Foxp3. Tr1 cells produce high levels of IL-10 and TGF-β, while tolerogenic DCs produce IL-10 that is important for Tr1 formation.
C, IL-10 has no role in the formation of Tr1 cells and tolerogenic DCs. TGF-β and Tregs are the only factors involved in the formation of Tr1 cells and tolerogenic DCs.
D, IL-10 induces the formation of Tr1 cells and tolerogenic DCs, which are dependent on IL-10 and Tregs, but differ from Tregs by expressing Foxp3. Tr1 cells produce low levels of IL-10 and TGF-β, while tolerogenic DCs produce IL-10 that is important for Tr1 formation.
E, IL-10 induces the formation of Tregs, which are dependent on TGF-β and Foxp3. Tr1 cells and tolerogenic DCs are not involved in this process.

Theory suggests that L dwarfs are a mixture of very-low-mass stars and sub-stellar objects (brown dwarfs), whereas the T dwarf class is composed entirely of brown dwarfs. The subsequent identification of many objects like GD 165B ultimately led to the definition of a new spectral class, the L dwarfs, defined in the red optical region of the spectrum not by metal-oxide absorption bands (TiO, VO), but by metal hydride emission bands (FeH, CrH, MgH, CaH) and prominent atomic lines of alkali metals (Na, K, Rb, Cs). , over 900 L dwarfs have been identified, most by wide-field surveys: the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), the Deep Near Infrared Survey of the Southern Sky (DENIS), and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Vertical mixing, clouds, metallicity, photochemistry, lightning, impact shocks and metallic catalysts might influence the temperature at which the L/T and T/Y transition occurs. ==== Secondary features ==== Brown dwarf spectral types Secondary features pec This suffix (e.g. L2pec) stands for ""peculiar"". sd This prefix (e.g. sdL0) stands for subdwarf and indicates a low metallicity and blue color β Objects with the beta (β) suffix (e.g. L4β) have an intermediate surface gravity. γ Objects with the gamma (γ) suffix (e.g. L5γ) have a low surface gravity. red The red suffix (e.g. L0red) indicates objects without signs of youth, but high dust content blue The blue suffix (e.g. L3blue) indicates unusual blue near-infrared colors for L dwarfs without obvious low metallicity Young brown dwarfs have low surface gravities because they have larger radii and lower masses compared to the field stars of similar spectral type. Astronomers classify self- luminous objects by spectral class, a distinction intimately tied to the surface temperature, and brown dwarfs occupy types M, L, T, and Y. Many brown dwarfs with spectral type M are young objects, such as Teide 1. ====Spectral class L==== thumb|Artist's vision of an L dwarf The defining characteristic of spectral class M, the coolest type in the long- standing classical stellar sequence, is an optical spectrum dominated by absorption bands of titanium(II) oxide (TiO) and vanadium(II) oxide (VO) molecules.

<<Question:>>
What is the reason behind the designation of Class L dwarfs, and what is their color and composition?

<<Options:>>
A, Class L dwarfs are hotter than M stars and are designated L because L is the remaining letter alphabetically closest to M. They are bright blue in color and are brightest in ultraviolet. Their atmosphere is hot enough to allow metal hydrides and alkali metals to be prominent in their spectra. Some of these objects have masses large enough to support hydrogen fusion and are therefore stars, but most are of substellar mass and are therefore brown dwarfs.
B, Class L dwarfs are cooler than M stars and are designated L because L is the remaining letter alphabetically closest to M. They are dark red in color and are brightest in infrared. Their atmosphere is cool enough to allow metal hydrides and alkali metals to be prominent in their spectra. Some of these objects have masses large enough to support hydrogen fusion and are therefore stars, but most are of substellar mass and are therefore brown dwarfs.
C, Class L dwarfs are hotter than M stars and are designated L because L is the next letter alphabetically after M. They are dark red in color and are brightest in infrared. Their atmosphere is cool enough to allow metal hydrides and alkali metals to be prominent in their spectra. Some of these objects have masses large enough to support hydrogen fusion and are therefore stars, but most are of substellar mass and are therefore brown dwarfs.
D, Class L dwarfs are cooler than M stars and are designated L because L is the next letter alphabetically after M. They are bright yellow in color and are brightest in visible light. Their atmosphere is hot enough to allow metal hydrides and alkali metals to be prominent in their spectra. Some of these objects have masses large enough to support hydrogen fusion and are therefore stars, but most are of substellar mass and are therefore brown dwarfs.
E, Class L dwarfs are cooler than M stars and are designated L because L is the remaining letter alphabetically closest to M. They are bright green in color and are brightest in visible light. Their atmosphere is cool enough to allow metal hydrides and alkali metals to be prominent in their spectra. Some of these objects have masses small enough to support hydrogen fusion and are therefore stars, but most are of substellar mass and are therefore brown dwarfs.

While this construction indeed predicted rectilinear propagation, it was difficult to reconcile with the common observation that wavefronts on the surface of water can bend around obstructions, and with the similar behavior of sound waves—causing Newton to maintain, to the end of his life, that if light consisted of waves it would ""bend and spread every way"" into the shadows.Newton, 1730, p. 362. The corpuscular theory of light, favored by Isaac Newton and accepted by nearly all of Fresnel's seniors, easily explained rectilinear propagation: the corpuscles obviously moved very fast, so that their paths were very nearly straight. This discovery gave Newton another reason to reject the wave theory: rays of light evidently had ""sides"".Newton, 1730, pp. 358–361. The corpuscular theory, with the hypothesis that the corpuscles were subject to forces acting perpendicular to surfaces, explained the same laws equally well,Darrigol, 2012, pp. 93–94,103. albeit with the implication that light traveled faster in denser media; that implication was wrong, but could not be directly disproven with the technology of Newton's time or even Fresnel's time . Newton, who called diffraction ""inflexion"", supposed that rays of light passing close to obstacles were bent (""inflected""); but his explanation was only qualitative.Darrigol, 2012, pp. 101–102; Newton, 1730, Book , Part . Newton offered an alternative ""Rule"" for the extraordinary refraction,Newton, 1730, p. 356. which rode on his authority through the 18th century, although he made ""no known attempt to deduce it from any principles of optics, corpuscular or otherwise."" 

<<Question:>>
What was Isaac Newton's explanation for rectilinear propagation of light?

<<Options:>>
A, Isaac Newton rejected the wave theory of light and proposed that light consists of corpuscles that are subject to a force acting parallel to the interface. In this model, the critical angle was the angle of incidence at which the normal velocity of the approaching corpuscle was just enough to reach the far side of the force field; at more oblique incidence, the corpuscle would be turned back.
B, Isaac Newton rejected the wave theory of light and proposed that light consists of corpuscles that are subject to a force acting perpendicular to the interface. In this model, the critical angle was the angle of incidence at which the normal velocity of the approaching corpuscle was just enough to reach the near side of the force field; at more oblique incidence, the corpuscle would be turned back.
C, Isaac Newton accepted the wave theory of light and proposed that light consists of transverse waves that are subject to a force acting perpendicular to the interface. In this model, the critical angle was the angle of incidence at which the normal velocity of the approaching wave was just enough to reach the far side of the force field; at more oblique incidence, the wave would be turned back.
D, Isaac Newton rejected the wave theory of light and proposed that light consists of corpuscles that are subject to a force acting perpendicular to the interface. In this model, the critical angle was the angle of incidence at which the normal velocity of the approaching corpuscle was just enough to reach the far side of the force field; at more oblique incidence, the corpuscle would be turned back.
E, Isaac Newton accepted the wave theory of light and proposed that light consists of longitudinal waves that are subject to a force acting perpendicular to the interface. In this model, the critical angle was the angle of incidence at which the normal velocity of the approaching wave was just enough to reach the far side of the force field; at more oblique incidence, the wave would be turned back.

In this way, chemical potential is a generalization of ""potentials"" in physics such as gravitational potential. Chemical potential is measured in units of energy/particle or, equivalently, energy/mole. The phrase ""chemical potential"" sometimes means ""total chemical potential"", but that is not universal. The chemical potentials of bosons and fermions is related to the number of particles and the temperature by Bose–Einstein statistics and Fermi–Dirac statistics respectively. ===Ideal vs. non-ideal solutions=== thumb|500px|The chemical potential of component i in solution for (left) ideal [incorrectly linearized] and (right) real solutions Generally the chemical potential is given as a sum of an ideal contribution and an excess contribution: : \mu_i = \mu_i^\text{ideal} + \mu_i^\text{excess}, In an ideal solution, the chemical potential of species i (μi) is dependent on temperature and pressure. μi0(T, P) is defined as the chemical potential of pure species i. In thermodynamics, the excess chemical potential is defined as the difference between the chemical potential of a given species and that of an ideal gas under the same conditions (in particular, at the same pressure, temperature, and composition). In this text, total chemical potential is usually called ""electrochemical potential"", but sometimes just ""chemical potential"".

C, Chemical potential, represented by μ, is a measure of the imbalance between quarks and antiquarks in a system. Higher μ indicates a stronger bias favoring antiquarks over quarks.
D, Chemical potential, represented by μ, is a measure of the density of antiquarks in a system. Higher μ indicates a higher density of antiquarks.

API gravity is thus an inverse measure of a petroleum liquid's density relative to that of water (also known as specific gravity). The American Petroleum Institute gravity, or API gravity, is a measure of how heavy or light a petroleum liquid is compared to water: if its API gravity is greater than 10, it is lighter and floats on water; if less than 10, it is heavier and sinks. API has entered petroleum industry nomenclature in a number of areas: * API gravity, a measure of the density of petroleum. API gravity is graduated in degrees on a hydrometer instrument. The scale was so firmly established that, by 1921, the remedy implemented by the American Petroleum Institute was to create the API gravity scale, recognizing the scale that was actually being used.API Degree history ==API gravity formulas== The formula to calculate API gravity from specific gravity (SG) is: :\text{API gravity} = \frac{141.5}{\text{SG}} - 131.5 Conversely, the specific gravity of petroleum liquids can be derived from their API gravity value as :\text{SG at}~60^\circ\text{F} = \frac{141.5}{\text{API gravity} + 131.5} Thus, a heavy oil with a specific gravity of 1.0 (i.e., with the same density as pure water at 60 °F) has an API gravity of: :\frac{141.5}{1.0} - 131.5 = 10.0^\circ{\text{API}} ==Using API gravity to calculate barrels of crude oil per metric ton== In the oil industry, quantities of crude oil are often measured in metric tons. For example, if one petroleum liquid is less dense than another, it has a greater API gravity.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

This resistance against deformation at high temperatures makes the refractory metals suitable against strong forces at high temperature, for example in jet engines, or tools used during forging. ===Chemical=== The refractory metals show a wide variety of chemical properties because they are members of three distinct groups in the periodic table. In many situations, the stability of the resistor is of primary importance, and thus the alloy's temperature coefficient of resistivity and corrosion resistance play a large part in material selection. Metal alloys can be engineered to have high resistance to shear, torque, and deformation. Some metals adopt different structures depending on the temperature. Combining different ratios of metals as alloys modifies the properties of pure metals to produce desirable characteristics. Within a certain range of strain this relationship is linear, so that the piezoresistive coefficient : \rho_\sigma = \frac{\left(\frac{\partial\rho}{\rho}\right)}{\varepsilon} where :∂ρ = Change in resistivity :ρ = Original resistivity :ε = Strain is constant. === Piezoresistivity in metals === Usually the resistance change in metals is mostly due to the change of geometry resulting from applied mechanical stress. 

<<Question:>>
What are the two main factors that cause resistance in a metal?

<<Options:>>
A, The amount of resistance in a metal is mainly caused by the temperature and the pressure applied to the metal. Higher temperatures cause bigger vibrations, and pressure causes the metal to become more compact, leading to more resistance.
B, The amount of resistance in a metal is mainly caused by the temperature and the purity of the metal. Higher temperatures cause bigger vibrations, and a mixture of different ions acts as an irregularity.
C, The amount of resistance in a metal is mainly caused by the temperature and the thickness of the metal. Higher temperatures cause bigger vibrations, and thicker metals have more irregularities, leading to more resistance.
D, The amount of resistance in a metal is mainly caused by the purity of the metal and the amount of pressure applied to the metal. A mixture of different ions acts as an irregularity, and pressure causes the metal to become more compact, leading to more resistance.

At larger distances, since the expansion rate of the universe has changed over time, the distance-redshift relation deviates from linearity, and this deviation depends on how the expansion rate has changed over time. The redshift is the relative increase in the wavelength emitted by a light source, in this case a galaxy, moving away from an observer from which its speed and then, using Hubble's Law, its distance can be calculated. Current evidence suggests that the expansion of the universe is accelerating (see Accelerating universe), meaning that for any given galaxy, the recession velocity dD/dt is increasing over time as the galaxy moves to greater and greater distances; however, the Hubble parameter is actually thought to be decreasing with time, meaning that if we were to look at some fixed distance D and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance, later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones. === Redshift velocity and recessional velocity === Redshift can be measured by determining the wavelength of a known transition, such as hydrogen α-lines for distant quasars, and finding the fractional shift compared to a stationary reference. The observational result of Hubble's Law, the proportional relationship between distance and the speed with which a galaxy is moving away from us (usually referred to as redshift) is a product of the cosmic distance ladder. Hubble's contribution was to show that the magnitude of the redshift correlated strongly with the distance to the galaxies. In standard inflationary cosmological models, the redshift of cosmological bodies is ascribed to the expansion of the universe, with greater redshift indicating greater cosmic distance from the Earth (see Hubble's Law). 

<<Question:>>
What is the significance of the redshift-distance relationship in determining the expansion history of the universe?

<<Options:>>
A, Observations of the redshift-distance relationship can be used to determine the expansion history of the universe and the matter and energy content, especially for galaxies whose light has been travelling to us for much shorter times.
B, Observations of the redshift-distance relationship can be used to determine the age of the universe and the matter and energy content, especially for nearby galaxies whose light has been travelling to us for much shorter times.
C, Observations of the redshift-distance relationship can be used to determine the expansion history of the universe and the matter and energy content, especially for nearby galaxies whose light has been travelling to us for much longer times.

An Evans balance, also known as a Johnson's balance (after a commercial producer of the Evans balance) is a device for measuring magnetic susceptibility. The Evans balance employs a similar sample configuration but measures the force on the magnet. ==Mechanism== The suspension trip has two pairs of magnets placed back-to-back, making a balanced system with a magnetic field at each end. The original Evans balance had an accuracy within 1% of literature values for diamagnetic solutions and within 2% of literature values of paramagnetic solids. The original Evans balance was described by the English scientist Dennis F. Evans in 1973, based on a torsional balance developed in 1937 by Alexander Rankine. Moreover, using a Evans balance is less time-consuming than using a Gouy or Faraday balances, although it is not sensitive and accurate in comparison to these last two systems. With the Evans balance, a reading could be taken in a matter of seconds with only small sacrifices in sensitivity and accuracy. 

<<Question:>>
What is the Evans balance?

<<Options:>>
A, The Evans balance is a system used to measure the change in weight of a sample when an electromagnet is turned on, which is proportional to the susceptibility.

C, The Evans balance is a system used to measure the magnetic field distortion around a sample immersed in water inside an MR scanner to determine its susceptibility.
D, The Evans balance is a system used to measure the susceptibility of a sample by measuring the force change on a strong compact magnet upon insertion of the sample.

This definition generalizes a property of the dimension of a Euclidean space or a vector space. The dimension of a physical quantity can be expressed as a product of the base physical dimensions such as length, mass and time, each raised to an integer (and occasionally rational) power. Dimensioning is the process of measuring either the area or the volume that an object occupies. In mathematics, metric dimension may refer to: * Metric dimension (graph theory), the minimum number of vertices of an undirected graph G in a subset S of G such that all other vertices are uniquely determined by their distances to the vertices in S * Minkowski–Bouligand dimension (also called the metric dimension), a way of determining the dimension of a fractal set in a Euclidean space by counting the number of fixed-size boxes needed to cover the set as a function of the box size * Equilateral dimension of a metric space (also called the metric dimension), the maximum number of points at equal distances from each other * Hausdorff dimension, an extended non-negative real number associated with any metric space that generalizes the notion of the dimension of a real vector space In mathematics, specifically linear algebra and geometry, relative dimension is the dual notion to codimension. The dimension of a physical quantity is more fundamental than some scale or unit used to express the amount of that physical quantity.

Heavy ion fusion is a fusion energy concept that uses a stream of high-energy ions from a particle accelerator to rapidly heat and compress a small pellet of fusion fuel. Here the plasma accelerator science provides the breakthrough to generate, sustain, and exploit the highest fields ever produced by science in the laboratory. thumb|400px|Wake created by an electron beam in a plasma What makes the system useful is the possibility of introducing waves of very high charge separation that propagate through the plasma similar to the traveling-wave concept in the conventional accelerator. It is hoped that a compact particle accelerator can be created based on plasma acceleration techniques or accelerators for much higher energy can be built, if long accelerators are realizable with an accelerating field of 10 GV/m. This is the HIF approach's major downside; although it is possible to build an accelerator with less beam current for testing purposes, the individual ions still require the same energy and thus the accelerator will be a similar size as a higher-current version for a production reactor. ===Advantages over lasers=== There are significant practical advantages to the use of ions over lasers. A charged particle accelerator is a complex machine that takes elementary charged particles and accelerates them to very high energies. Migma uses self-intersecting beams of ions from small particle accelerators to force the ions to fuse.

In astronomy, the interstellar medium (ISM) is the matter and radiation that exist in the space between the star systems in a galaxy. The interstellar medium is composed of multiple phases distinguished by whether matter is ionic, atomic, or molecular, and the temperature and density of the matter. The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) with an average density of less than one atom per cubic meter. The interstellar medium is composed, primarily, of hydrogen, followed by helium with trace amounts of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. Most stars do not form in isolation but as part of a group of stars referred as star clusters or stellar associations. ==Stellar nurseries== ===Interstellar clouds=== A spiral galaxy like the Milky Way contains stars, stellar remnants, and a diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) of gas and dust. Stars form within the densest regions of the ISM, which ultimately contributes to molecular clouds and replenishes the ISM with matter and energy through planetary nebulae, stellar winds, and supernovae.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

The change in slope of the pinched hysteresis curves demonstrates switching between different resistance states which is a phenomenon central to ReRAM and other forms of two-terminal resistance memory. At high frequencies, memristive theory predicts the pinched hysteresis effect will degenerate, resulting in a straight line representative of a linear resistor. The video also illustrates how to understand deviations in the pinched hysteresis characteristics of physical memristors. Thus for pure memristors f (i.e. the rate of change of the state) must be equal or proportional to the current i(t) . ===Pinched hysteresis=== thumb|right|Example of pinched hysteresis curve, V versus I One of the resulting properties of memristors and memristive systems is the existence of a pinched hysteresis effect. It has been proven that some types of non-crossing pinched hysteresis curves (denoted Type-II) cannot be described by memristors. === Memristive networks and mathematical models of circuit interactions === The concept of memristive networks was first introduced by Leon Chua in his 1965 paper ""Memristive Devices and Systems."" An experimental identification of memristive behaviour is the ""pinched hysteresis loop"" in the v-i plane.

In mathematical physics, geometric quantization is a mathematical approach to defining a quantum theory corresponding to a given classical theory. As a mere representation change, however, Weyl's map is useful and important, as it underlies the alternate equivalent phase space formulation of conventional quantum mechanics. == Geometric quantization == In mathematical physics, geometric quantization is a mathematical approach to defining a quantum theory corresponding to a given classical theory. In particular, quantization, namely the construction of a quantum theory whose classical limit is a given and known classical theory, becomes an important area of quantum physics in itself. In theoretical physics, quantum geometry is the set of mathematical concepts generalizing the concepts of geometry whose understanding is necessary to describe the physical phenomena at distance scales comparable to the Planck length. It attempts to carry out quantization, for which there is in general no exact recipe, in such a way that certain analogies between the classical theory and the quantum theory remain manifest.

It is used as a symmetry operation in the context of geometric symmetry, molecular symmetry and crystallography, where an object that is unchanged by a combination of rotation and reflection is said to have improper rotation symmetry. == Three dimensions== In 3 dimensions, improper rotation is equivalently defined as a combination of rotation about an axis and inversion in a point on the axis. Reflection and inversion are each special case of improper rotation. In either the narrower or the wider senses, the composition of two improper rotations is a proper rotation, and the composition of an improper and a proper rotation is an improper rotation. == Physical systems== When studying the symmetry of a physical system under an improper rotation (e.g., if a system has a mirror symmetry plane), it is important to distinguish between vectors and pseudovectors (as well as scalars and pseudoscalars, and in general between tensors and pseudotensors), since the latter transform differently under proper and improper rotations (in 3 dimensions, pseudovectors are invariant under inversion). ==See also== *Isometry *Orthogonal group ==References== Category:Euclidean symmetries Category:Lie groups An improper rotation of an object thus produces a rotation of its mirror image. There are several different systems for naming individual improper rotations: * In the Schoenflies notation the symbol Sn (German, , for mirror), where n must be even, denotes the symmetry group generated by an n-fold improper rotation. Any improper rotation is an affine transformation and, in cases that keep the coordinate origin fixed, a linear transformation..

Power density is the amount of power (time rate of energy transfer) per unit volume. Energy density differs from energy conversion efficiency (net output per input) or embodied energy (the energy output costs to provide, as harvesting, refining, distributing, and dealing with pollution all use energy). Renewable energy sources have power density at least three orders of magnitude smaller and for the same energy output they need to occupy accordingly larger area, which has been already highlighted as a limiting factor of renewable energy in German Energiewende. Measured in `W/m2` it describes the amount of power obtained per unit of Earth surface area used by a specific energy system, including all supporting infrastructure, manufacturing, mining of fuel (if applicable) and decommissioning., Fossil fuels and nuclear power are characterized by high power density which means large power can be drawn from power plants occupying relatively small area. In energy transformers including batteries, fuel cells, motors, power supply units etc., power density refers to a volume, where it is often called volume power density, expressed as W/m3. In physics, energy density is the amount of energy stored in a given system or region of space per unit volume.

B, Power density is a measure of the amount of power obtained per unit of Earth surface area used by a specific energy system, including all supporting infrastructure, manufacturing, mining of fuel (if applicable) and decommissioning. Fossil fuels and nuclear power have high power density, which means large power can be drawn from power plants occupying relatively small areas. Renewable energy sources have power density at least three orders of magnitude smaller and, for the same energy output, they need to occupy accordingly larger areas.
C, Power density is a measure of the amount of power obtained per unit of Earth surface area used by a specific energy system, including all supporting infrastructure, manufacturing, mining of fuel (if applicable) and decommissioning. Renewable energy sources have higher power density than non-renewable energy sources, which means that they can produce more power from power plants occupying smaller areas.
D, Power density is a measure of the amount of power obtained per unit of Earth surface area used by a specific energy system, including all supporting infrastructure, manufacturing, mining of fuel (if applicable) and decommissioning. Fossil fuels and nuclear power have low power density, which means that they need to occupy larger areas to produce the same amount of power as renewable energy sources.
E, Power density is a measure of the amount of power obtained per unit of Earth surface area used by a specific energy system, including all supporting infrastructure, manufacturing, mining of fuel (if applicable) and decommissioning. Both renewable and non-renewable energy sources have low power density, which means that they need to occupy larger areas to produce the same amount of power.

Linear frame dragging is the similarly inevitable result of the general principle of relativity, applied to linear momentum. Frame-dragging is an effect on spacetime, predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, that is due to non-static stationary distributions of mass–energy. While not strictly a frame dragging effect (the term frame dragging is not used by Einstein), it is demonstrated by Einstein that it derives from the same equation of general relativity. Although it arguably has equal theoretical legitimacy to the ""rotational"" effect, the difficulty of obtaining an experimental verification of the effect means that it receives much less discussion and is often omitted from articles on frame-dragging (but see Einstein, 1921).Einstein, A The Meaning of Relativity (contains transcripts of his 1921 Princeton lectures). In 2015, new general-relativistic extensions of Newtonian rotation laws were formulated to describe geometric dragging of frames which incorporates a newly discovered antidragging effect. ==Effects== Rotational frame-dragging (the Lense–Thirring effect) appears in the general principle of relativity and similar theories in the vicinity of rotating massive objects.

In theoretical physics, explicit symmetry breaking is the breaking of a symmetry of a theory by terms in its defining equations of motion (most typically, to the Lagrangian or the Hamiltonian) that do not respect the symmetry. In the latter, the defining equations respect the symmetry but the ground state (vacuum) of the theory breaks it.Castellani, E. (2003) ""On the meaning of Symmetry Breaking"" in Brading, K. and Castellani, E. (eds) Symmetries in Physics: New Reflections, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press Explicit symmetry breaking is also associated with electromagnetic radiation. Symmetry breaking can be distinguished into two types, explicit and spontaneous. Explicit symmetry breaking differs from spontaneous symmetry breaking. The explicit symmetry breaking occurs at a smaller energy scale. Usually this term is used in situations where these symmetry- breaking terms are small, so that the symmetry is approximately respected by the theory.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

Fermions, such as the leptons and quarks in the Standard Model, can also acquire mass as a result of their interaction with the Higgs field, but not in the same way as the gauge bosons. === Structure of the Higgs field === In the standard model, the Higgs field is an SU(2) doublet (i.e. the standard representation with two complex components called isospin), which is a scalar under Lorentz transformations. In the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs mechanism is essential to explain the generation mechanism of the property ""mass"" for gauge bosons. Certain elementary bosons (e.g. gluons) act as force carriers, which give rise to forces between other particles, while one (the Higgs boson) gives rise to the phenomenon of mass. The Alternative models to the Standard Higgs Model are models which are considered by many particle physicists to solve some of the Higgs boson's existing problems. According to the Standard Model, the W and Z bosons gain mass via the Higgs mechanism. Gauge bosons are different from the other kinds of bosons: first, fundamental scalar bosons (the Higgs boson); second, mesons, which are composite bosons, made of quarks; third, larger composite, non-force-carrying bosons, such as certain atoms. ==Gauge bosons in the Standard Model== The Standard Model of particle physics recognizes four kinds of gauge bosons: photons, which carry the electromagnetic interaction; W and Z bosons, which carry the weak interaction; and gluons, which carry the strong interaction. 

<<Question:>>
What is the role of the Higgs boson in the Standard Model?

<<Options:>>
A, The Higgs boson is responsible for giving mass to the photon and gluon in the Standard Model.

In relativistic physics, Lorentz symmetry or Lorentz invariance, named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz, is an equivalence of observation or observational symmetry due to special relativity implying that the laws of physics stay the same for all observers that are moving with respect to one another within an inertial frame. For example, the following laws, equations, and theories respect Lorentz symmetry: * The kinematical laws of special relativity * Maxwell's field equations in the theory of electromagnetism * The Dirac equation in the theory of the electron * The Standard Model of particle physics The Lorentz group expresses the fundamental symmetry of space and time of all known fundamental laws of nature. Their new symmetry is called very special relativity (VSR). ==See also== * Lorentz violation ==References== Category:Theory of relativity Lorentz covariance has two distinct, but closely related meanings: # A physical quantity is said to be Lorentz covariant if it transforms under a given representation of the Lorentz group. The Lorentz group is a Lie group of symmetries of the spacetime of special relativity. In a relativistic theory of physics, a Lorentz scalar is an expression, formed from items of the theory, which evaluates to a scalar, invariant under any Lorentz transformation.

A, Lorentz symmetry or Lorentz invariance is a property of the underlying spacetime manifold that describes the feature of nature that says experimental results are independent of the orientation or the boost velocity of the laboratory through space.
B, Lorentz symmetry or Lorentz invariance is a measure of the curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of massive objects, which describes the feature of nature that says experimental results are independent of the orientation or the boost velocity of the laboratory through space.
C, Lorentz symmetry or Lorentz invariance is a physical quantity that transforms under a given representation of the Lorentz group, built out of scalars, four-vectors, four-tensors, and spinors.
D, Lorentz symmetry or Lorentz invariance is a measure of the time dilation and length contraction effects predicted by special relativity, which states that the laws of physics stay the same for all observers that are moving with respect to one another within an inertial frame.

In cosmology, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are fluctuations in the density of the visible baryonic matter (normal matter) of the universe, caused by acoustic density waves in the primordial plasma of the early universe. Therefore, the BAO technique helps constrain cosmological parameters and provide further insight into the nature of dark energy. ==See also== * Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey * BINGO (telescope) * Euclid (spacecraft) ==References== ==External links== * Martin White's Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Dark Energy Web Page * * Review of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations * SDSS BAO Press Release Category:Physical cosmology Category:Baryons The BAO signal is a standard ruler such that the length of the sound horizon can be measured as a function of cosmic time. BAO measurements help cosmologists understand more about the nature of dark energy (which causes the accelerating expansion of the universe) by constraining cosmological parameters. ==The early universe== The early universe consisted of a hot, dense plasma of electrons and baryons (which include protons and neutrons). BINGO (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations) is a transit radio telescope currently under construction that will observe redshifted hydrogen line emission (between z = 0.13 and 0.45) by intensity mapping to measure dark energy through baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the radio frequency band. They are often used to tie some observable quantity (such as the luminosity of a distant quasar, the redshift of a distant galaxy, or the angular size of the acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum) to another quantity that is not directly observable, but is more convenient for calculations (such as the comoving coordinates of the quasar, galaxy, etc.). 

<<Question:>>
What is the significance of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) in the study of the universe?

<<Options:>>
A, BAOs establish a preferred length scale for baryons, which can be used to detect a subtle preference for pairs of galaxies to be separated by 147 Mpc, compared to those separated by 130-160 Mpc.
B, BAOs help to determine the average temperature of the Universe by measuring the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation.
C, BAOs provide a way to measure the time it takes for a signal to reach its destination compared to the time it takes for background noise to dissipate.
D, BAOs can be used to make a two-dimensional map of the galaxy distribution in the Universe.
E, BAOs are used to measure the speed of light in the Universe.

As the density of states at the Fermi level varies widely between systems, this approximation is a reasonable heuristic for inferring when it may be necessary to include electronic entropy in the thermodynamic description of a system; only systems with large densities of states at the Fermi level should exhibit non-negligible electronic entropy (where large may be approximately defined as ). == Application to different materials classes == Insulators have zero density of states at the Fermi level due to their band gaps. Metals have non-zero density of states at the Fermi level. Metals with free-electron-like band structures (e.g. alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, Cu, and Al) generally exhibit relatively low density of states at the Fermi level, and therefore exhibit fairly low electronic entropies. Electronic entropy is thus most relevant for the thermodynamics of condensed phases, where the density of states at the Fermi level can be quite large, and the electronic entropy can thus contribute substantially to thermodynamic behavior. Several other approximations can be made, but they all indicate that the electronic entropy should, to first order, be proportional to the temperature and the density of states at the Fermi level. Thus, the density of states- based electronic entropy is essentially zero in these systems. 

<<Question:>>
What can be inferred about the electronic entropy of insulators and metals based on their densities of states at the Fermi level?

<<Options:>>
A, Insulators and metals have zero density of states at the Fermi level, and therefore, their density of states-based electronic entropy is essentially zero.
B, Insulators have zero density of states at the Fermi level, and therefore, their density of states-based electronic entropy is essentially zero. Metals have non-zero density of states at the Fermi level, and thus, their electronic entropy should be proportional to the temperature and density of states at the Fermi level.
C, Insulators have non-zero density of states at the Fermi level, and therefore, their density of states-based electronic entropy is proportional to the temperature and density of states at the Fermi level. Metals have zero density of states at the Fermi level, and thus, their electronic entropy is essentially zero.
D, Insulators and metals have varying densities of states at the Fermi level, and thus, their electronic entropy may or may not be proportional to the temperature and density of states at the Fermi level.
E, Insulators and metals have non-zero density of states at the Fermi level, and thus, their electronic entropy should be proportional to the temperature and density of states at the Fermi level.

In mathematics, a permutation group is a group G whose elements are permutations of a given set M and whose group operation is the composition of permutations in G (which are thought of as bijective functions from the set M to itself). # Every bijection has an inverse function that undoes its action, and thus each element of a symmetric group does have an inverse which is a permutation too. === Transpositions, sign, and the alternating group === A transposition is a permutation which exchanges two elements and keeps all others fixed; for example (1 3) is a transposition. In the context of molecular symmetry, a symmetry operation is a permutation of atoms such that the molecule or crystal is transformed into a state indistinguishable from the starting state. # Symmetry operations can be collected together in groups which are isomorphic to permutation groups. Subgroups of symmetric groups are called permutation groups and are widely studied because of their importance in understanding group actions, homogeneous spaces, and automorphism groups of graphs, such as the Higman–Sims group and the Higman–Sims graph. == Group properties and special elements == The elements of the symmetric group on a set X are the permutations of X. === Multiplication === The group operation in a symmetric group is function composition, denoted by the symbol ∘ or simply by just a composition of the permutations. The way in which the elements of a permutation group permute the elements of the set is called its group action.

If a dielectric material does not include light-absorbent additive molecules (pigments, dyes, colorants), it is usually transparent to the spectrum of visible light. In other words, a translucent material is made up of components with different indices of refraction. In electrical engineering, dielectric loss quantifies a dielectric material's inherent dissipation of electromagnetic energy (e.g. heat).http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/ch01.pdf It can be parameterized in terms of either the loss angle or the corresponding loss tangent . Such frequencies of light waves are said to be transmitted. ===Transparency in insulators=== An object may be not transparent either because it reflects the incoming light or because it absorbs the incoming light. Electromagnetically Induced Transparency. In the field of optics, transparency (also called pellucidity or diaphaneity) is the physical property of allowing light to pass through the material without appreciable scattering of light.

Recently, MRI has been demonstrated also at ultra-low fields, i.e., in the microtesla-to-millitesla range, where sufficient signal quality is made possible by prepolarization (on the order of 10–100 mT) and by measuring the Larmor precession fields at about 100 microtesla with highly sensitive superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). ===T1 and T2=== thumb|Effects of TR and TE on MR signal Each tissue returns to its equilibrium state after excitation by the independent relaxation processes of T1 (spin-lattice; that is, magnetization in the same direction as the static magnetic field) and T2 (spin-spin; transverse to the static magnetic field). However, in practical MRI there are small differences in the static magnetic field at different spatial locations (""inhomogeneities"") that cause the Larmor frequency to vary across the body. The static fields used most commonly in MRI cause precession which corresponds to a radiofrequency (RF) photon. Moreover, the quality of MR imaging deteriorates below 10 °C. ==History== In 1971 at Stony Brook University, Paul Lauterbur applied magnetic field gradients in all three dimensions and a back-projection technique to create NMR images. Quantitative T1ρ MRI relaxation maps reflect the biochemical composition of tissues. ===Imaging=== T1ρ MRI has been used to image tissues such as cartilage, intervertebral discs, brain, and heart, as well as certain types of cancers. ==See also== *Relaxation (NMR) *Spin-spin relaxation time *Ernst angle ==References== *McRobbie D., et al. MRI, From picture to proton. 2003 *Hashemi Ray, et al. MRI, The Basics 2ED. 2004. This gives a temporal resolution of 20–30 ms for images with an in-plane resolution of 1.5–2.0 mm. Balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) imaging has a better image contrast between the blood pool and myocardium than the FLASH MRI, yet it will produce severe banding artifact when the B0 inhomogeneity is strong. 

<<Question:>>
What is the purpose of measuring the Larmor precession fields at about 100 microtesla with highly sensitive superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) in ultra-low field MRI?

<<Options:>>
A, To measure the magnetization in the same direction as the static magnetic field in T1 relaxation.
B, To create a T1-weighted image that is useful for assessing the cerebral cortex, identifying fatty tissue, and characterizing focal liver lesions.
C, To obtain sufficient signal quality in the microtesla-to-millitesla range, where MRI has been demonstrated recently.
D, To measure the independent relaxation processes of T1 and T2 in each tissue after excitation.
E, To change the repetition time (TR) and obtain morphological information in post-contrast imaging.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

As visual perception varies logarithmically, it is helpful to have an appreciation of both illuminance and luminance by orders of magnitude. ==Illuminance== To help compare different orders of magnitude, the following list describes various source of lux, which is measured in lumens per square metre. Luminance is a photometric measure of the luminous intensity per unit area of light travelling in a given direction. More generally, the luminance along a light ray can be defined as L_\mathrm{v} = n^2\frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi_\mathrm{v}}{\mathrm{d}G} where * d is the etendue of an infinitesimally narrow beam containing the specified ray, * dv is the luminous flux carried by this beam, * is the index of refraction of the medium. ==Relation to illuminance== thumb|upright=1.5|Comparison of photometric and radiometric quantities The luminance of a reflecting surface is related to the illuminance it receives: \int_{\Omega_\Sigma} L_\text{v} \mathrm{d}\Omega_\Sigma \cos \theta_\Sigma = M_\text{v} = E_\text{v} R, where the integral covers all the directions of emission , * v is the surface's luminous exitance, * v is the received illuminance, * is the reflectance. Luminance, the original meaning of brightness, is the amount of light per solid angle coming from an area, such as the sky. In photometry, illuminance is the total luminous flux incident on a surface, per unit area. Then the relationship is simply L_\text{v} = \frac{E_\text{v} R}{\pi}. ==Units== A variety of units have been used for luminance, besides the candela per square metre. ==See also== *Relative luminance *Orders of magnitude (luminance) *Diffuse reflection *Etendue * *Lambertian reflectance *Lightness (color) *Luma, the representation of luminance in a video monitor *Lumen (unit) *Radiance, radiometric quantity analogous to luminance *Brightness, the subjective impression of luminance *Glare (vision) ===Table of SI light- related units=== ==References== == External links == * A Kodak guide to Estimating Luminance and Illuminance using a camera's exposure meter. 

<<Question:>>

<<Options:>>
A, Illuminance is the amount of light absorbed by a surface per unit area, while luminance is the amount of light reflected by a surface per unit area.

C, Illuminance is the amount of light concentrated into a smaller area, while luminance is the amount of light filling a larger solid angle.
D, Illuminance is the amount of light emitted by a source per unit area, while luminance is the amount of light falling on a surface per unit area.

In particle physics, a magnetic monopole is a hypothetical elementary particle that is an isolated magnet with only one magnetic pole (a north pole without a south pole or vice versa). A magnetic monopole, if it exists, would have the defining property of producing a magnetic field whose monopole term is non-zero. A true magnetic monopole would be a new elementary particle, and would violate Gauss's law for magnetism . (See below.) ==Poles and magnetism in ordinary matter== All matter isolated to date, including every atom on the periodic table and every particle in the Standard Model, has zero magnetic monopole charge. A magnetic monopole would have a net north or south ""magnetic charge"". In some theoretical models, magnetic monopoles are unlikely to be observed, because they are too massive to create in particle accelerators (see below), and also too rare in the Universe to enter a particle detector with much probability. 

<<Question:>>

The redshift due to expansion of the universe depends upon the recessional velocity in a fashion determined by the cosmological model chosen to describe the expansion of the universe, which is very different from how Doppler redshift depends upon local velocity.. There is a distinction between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect redshift. The redshifts of galaxies include both a component related to recessional velocity from expansion of the universe, and a component related to peculiar motion (Doppler shift). Conversely, Doppler effect redshifts () are associated with objects receding (moving away) from the observer with the light shifting to lower energies. Popular literature often uses the expression ""Doppler redshift"" instead of ""cosmological redshift"" to describe the redshift of galaxies dominated by the expansion of spacetime, but the cosmological redshift is not found using the relativistic Doppler equationOdenwald & Fienberg 1993 which is instead characterized by special relativity; thus is impossible while, in contrast, is possible for cosmological redshifts because the space which separates the objects (for example, a quasar from the Earth) can expand faster than the speed of light.Speed faster than light is allowed because the expansion of the spacetime metric is described by general relativity in terms of sequences of only locally valid inertial frames as opposed to a global Minkowski metric. Redshift is a shift in the spectrum of the emitted electromagnetic radiation from an object toward lower energies and frequencies, associated with the phenomenon of the Doppler effect. 

<<Question:>>
What is the difference between redshift due to the expansion of the universe and Doppler redshift?

<<Options:>>
A, Redshift due to the expansion of the universe depends on the rate of change of a(t) at the times of emission or absorption, while Doppler redshift depends on the increase of a(t) in the whole period from emission to absorption.
B, Redshift due to the expansion of the universe depends on the local velocity of the object emitting the light, while Doppler redshift depends on the cosmological model chosen to describe the expansion of the universe.
C, There is no difference between redshift due to the expansion of the universe and Doppler redshift.
D, Redshift due to the expansion of the universe depends on the cosmological model chosen to describe the expansion of the universe, while Doppler redshift depends on the local velocity of the object emitting the light.
E, Redshift due to the expansion of the universe depends on the increase of a(t) in the whole period from emission to absorption, while Doppler redshift depends on the rate of change of a(t) at the times of emission or absorption.

UTC (on which civil time is usually based) is a compromise, stepping with atomic seconds but periodically reset by a leap second to match UT1. It is the basis for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface and which has leap seconds. A time scale in which the seconds are not exactly equal to atomic seconds is UT1, a form of universal time. A leap second is a one-second adjustment that is occasionally applied to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), to accommodate the difference between precise time (International Atomic Time (TAI), as measured by atomic clocks) and imprecise observed solar time (UT1), which varies due to irregularities and long-term slowdown in the Earth's rotation. Universal Time (UT or UT1) is a time standard based on Earth's rotation. Since 1972, UTC is calculated by subtracting the accumulated leap seconds from International Atomic Time (TAI), which is a coordinate time scale tracking notional proper time on the rotating surface of the Earth (the geoid). 

<<Question:>>
What is the relationship between Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and Universal Time (UT1)?

<<Options:>>
A, UTC and Universal Time (UT1) are identical time scales that are used interchangeably in science and engineering.
B, UTC is a time scale that is completely independent of Universal Time (UT1). UTC is kept within 0.9 second of UT1 by the introduction of one-second steps to UTC, the ""leap second"".
C, UTC is an atomic time scale designed to approximate Universal Time (UT1), but it differs from UT1 by a non-integral number of seconds. UTC is kept within 0.9 second of UT1 by the introduction of one-second steps to UTC, the ""leap second"".
D, UTC is an atomic time scale designed to approximate Universal Time (UT1), but it differs from UT1 by an integral number of seconds. UTC is kept within 0.9 second of UT1 by the introduction of one-second steps to UTC, the ""leap second"".

Bringing a metal to its forging temperature allows the metal's shape to be changed by applying a relatively small force, without creating cracks. Forging temperature is the temperature at which a metal becomes substantially more soft, but is lower than the melting temperature, such that it can be reshaped by forging. To make steel harder, it must be heated to very high temperatures. Selecting the maximum forging temperature allows metals to be forged more easily, lowering the forging pressure and thus the wear on metal-forming dies. This is an important industrial mechanism in preventing the softening of materials at high temperature. ==Inhibition== Certain materials especially refractories which are processed at high temperatures end up with excessively large grain size and poor mechanical properties at room temperature. The temperature at which a metal is forged can affect the homogeneity in microstructure and mechanical properties of forged products, which can highly affect the performance of products used in manufacturing. 

<<Question:>>
What is the reason for heating metals to a temperature just above the upper critical temperature?

<<Options:>>

The variance in the Moon's orbital distance corresponds with changes in its tangential and angular speeds, as stated in Kepler's second law. The reason for the difference in distance is that the distance from the center of the Moon to the center of the Earth is nearly constant throughout the night, but an observer on the surface of Earth is actually 1 Earth radius from the center of Earth. The Moon's orbit around Earth has many variations (perturbations) due to the gravitational attraction of the Sun and planets, the study of which (lunar theory) has a long history. === Elliptic shape === The orbit of the Moon is a nearly circular ellipse about the Earth (the semimajor and semiminor axes are 384,400 km and 383,800 km, respectively: a difference of only 0.16%). Tycho's subsequent investigations pinned down the cause, a previously unrecognized inequality, since then called the variation. ==Variation== The main visible effect (in longitude) of the variation of the Moon is that during the course of every month, at the octants of the Moon's phase that follow the syzygies (i.e. halfway between the new or the full moon and the next-following quarter), the Moon is about two thirds of a degree farther ahead than would be expected on the basis of its mean motion (as modified by the equation of the centre and by the evection). The time-averaged distance between the centers of Earth and the Moon is . These perturbations are well understood and the lunar distance can be accurately modeled over thousands of years. === Tidal dissipation === Through the action of tidal forces, the angular momentum of Earth's rotation is slowly being transferred to the Moon's orbit.

Remnants which could only be created by significantly higher ejection energies than a standard supernova are called hypernova remnants, after the high-energy hypernova explosion that is assumed to have created them. ==Origin of cosmic rays== Supernova remnants are considered the major source of galactic cosmic rays. A supernova remnant (SNR) is the structure resulting from the explosion of a star in a supernova. One of the best observed young supernova remnants was formed by SN 1987A, a supernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud that was observed in February 1987. In the late 1990s it was proposed that recent supernova remnants could be found by looking for gamma rays from the decay of titanium-44. It was the first supernova to be detected through its neutrino emission and the first to be observed across every band of the electromagnetic spectrum. Later called SN 1572, this supernova was associated with a remnant during the 1960s. 

<<Question:>>
What is the origin of the radio emission observed from supernova remnants?

<<Options:>>
A, The radio emission from supernova remnants originates from the rebound of gas falling inward during the supernova explosion. This emission is a form of non-thermal emission called synchrotron emission.
B, The radio emission from supernova remnants originates from high-velocity electrons oscillating within magnetic fields. This emission is a form of non-thermal emission called synchrotron emission.
C, The radio emission from supernova remnants originates from the fusion of hydrogen and helium in the core of the star. This emission is a form of non-thermal emission called synchrotron emission.
D, The radio emission from supernova remnants originates from the expansion of the shell of gas during the supernova explosion. This emission is a form of thermal emission called synchrotron emission.
E, The radio emission from supernova remnants originates from the ionized gas present in the remnants. This emission is a form of thermal emission called synchrotron emission.

which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions

An introductory theorem shows that for every eigenstate of one Hamiltonian, its partner Hamiltonian has a corresponding eigenstate with the same energy (except possibly for zero energy eigenstates). SUSY quantum mechanics involves pairs of Hamiltonians which share a particular mathematical relationship, which are called partner Hamiltonians. Thus, if a Hamiltonian matrix has as an eigenvalue, then , and are also eigenvalues. Furthermore, the sum (and any linear combination) of two Hamiltonian matrices is again Hamiltonian, as is their commutator. In quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian of a system is an operator corresponding to the total energy of that system, including both kinetic energy and potential energy. The SUSY partner of this Hamiltonian would be ""fermionic"", and its eigenstates would be the theory's fermions.

Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities occur when large swirls of plasma travel along the edge of the magnetosphere at a different velocity from the magnetosphere, causing the plasma to slip past. The position of the magnetopause depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity.Russell, 2001, pp. 1015–1016 In front of the magnetopause (at a distance from 80 to 130 RJ from the planet's center) lies the bow shock, a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere.Krupp, 2004, pp. 15–16Russel, 1993, pp. 725–727 The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the magnetosheath. thumb|left|An artist's concept of a magnetosphere, where plasmasphere (7) refers to the plasma torus and sheet At the opposite side of the planet, the solar wind stretches Jupiter's magnetic field lines into a long, trailing magnetotail, which sometimes extends well beyond the orbit of Saturn. The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the magnetosphere of flux tubes filled with plasma. This is a form of Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. For stars, this is usually the boundary between the stellar wind and interstellar medium; for planets, the speed of the solar wind there decreases as it approaches the magnetopause. ===Magnetosheath=== The magnetosheath is the region of the magnetosphere between the bow shock and the magnetopause. thumb|right|Numerical simulation of a temporal Kelvin–Helmholtz instability The Kelvin–Helmholtz instability (after Lord Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz) is a fluid instability that occurs when there is velocity shear in a single continuous fluid or a velocity difference across the interface between two fluids. 

<<Question:>>
What is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and how does it affect Earth's magnetosphere?

<<Options:>>
A, The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a phenomenon that occurs when large swirls of plasma travel along the edge of the magnetosphere at a different velocity from the magnetosphere, causing the plasma to slip past. This results in magnetic reconnection, and as the magnetic field lines break and reconnect, solar wind particles are able to enter the magnetosphere.
B, The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a phenomenon that occurs when the magnetosphere is compared to a sieve because it allows solar wind particles to enter.
C, The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a phenomenon that occurs when Earth's bow shock is about 17 kilometers (11 mi) thick and located about 90,000 kilometers (56,000 mi) from Earth.
D, The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a phenomenon that occurs when the magnetic field extends in the magnetotail on Earth's nightside, which lengthwise exceeds 6,300,000 kilometers (3,900,000 mi).
E, The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a phenomenon that occurs when the magnetosphere is compressed by the solar wind to a distance of approximately 65,000 kilometers (40,000 mi) on the dayside of Earth. This results in the magnetopause existing at a distance of several hundred kilometers above Earth's surface.

Corresponding models of baryons are referred to as quark–diquark models. The diquark is often treated as a single subatomic particle with which the third quark interacts via the strong interaction. Each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle known as an antibaryon in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks. Diquark–antidiquark pairs have also been advanced for anomalous particles such as the X(3872). == Formation == The forces between the two quarks in a diquark is attractive when both the colors and spins are antisymmetric. Each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle (antibaryon) where their corresponding antiquarks replace quarks. In particle physics, a diquark, or diquark correlation/clustering, is a hypothetical state of two quarks grouped inside a baryon (that consists of three quarks) (Lichtenberg 1982). 

<<Question:>>
What is the explanation for the effective supersymmetry in quark-diquark models?

<<Options:>>
A, Two different color charges close together appear as the corresponding anti-color under coarse resolution, which makes a diquark cluster viewed with coarse resolution effectively appear as an antiquark. Therefore, a baryon containing 3 valence quarks, of which two tend to cluster together as a diquark, behaves like a meson.
B, Two different color charges close together appear as the corresponding color under coarse resolution, which makes a diquark cluster viewed with coarse resolution effectively appear as a quark. Therefore, a baryon containing 3 valence quarks, of which two tend to cluster together as a diquark, behaves like a baryon.
C, Two different color charges close together appear as the corresponding color under fine resolution, which makes a diquark cluster viewed with fine resolution effectively appear as a quark. Therefore, a baryon containing 3 valence quarks, of which two tend to cluster together as a diquark, behaves like a baryon.
D, Two different color charges close together appear as the corresponding anti-color under fine resolution, which makes a diquark cluster viewed with fine resolution effectively appear as an antiquark. Therefore, a baryon containing 3 valence quarks, of which two tend to cluster together as a diquark, behaves like a meson.
E, Two different color charges close together appear as the corresponding anti-color under any resolution, which makes a diquark cluster viewed with any resolution effectively appear as an antiquark. Therefore, a baryon containing 3 valence quarks, of which two tend to cluster together as a diquark, behaves like a meson.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

The complete Hamiltonian of a diatomic molecule (as for all molecules) commutes with the parity operation P or E* and rovibronic (rotation-vibration-electronic) energy levels (often called rotational levels) can be given the parity symmetry label + or -. In addition, symmetrical diatomic molecules have even (g) or odd (u) parity and obey the Laporte rule that only transitions between states of opposite parity are allowed. == Case (b) == In case (b), the spin-orbit coupling is weak or non- existent (in the case \Lambda=0). As the perturbation operator H' (or H ) commutes with the symmetry operators of the molecule, this case will happen if the two electronic states \left| \Phi _{1}^{(0)} \right\rangle and \left| \Phi _{2}^{(0)} \right\rangle have different point group symmetries (for example if they correspond to two electronic terms having different values of \Lambda , different electronic parities g and u, different multiplicities, or for example are the two terms {{\Sigma }^{+}} and {{\Sigma }^{-}} ) as it can be shown that, for a scalar quantity whose operator commutes with the angular momentum and inversion operators, only the matrix elements for transitions between states of the same angular momentum and parity are non-zero and the proof remains valid, in essentially the same form, for the general case of an arbitrary symmetry operator. Wiley To see that the parity's eigenvalues are phase factors, we assume an eigenstate of the parity operation (this is realized because the intrinsic parity is a property of a particle species) and use the fact that two parity transformations leave the particle in the same state, thus the new wave function can differ by only a phase factor, i.e.: P^{2} \psi = e^{i \phi} \psi thus P \psi = \pm e^{i \phi /2} \psi, since these are the only eigenstates satisfying the above equation. In quantum mechanics, the intrinsic parity is a phase factor that arises as an eigenvalue of the parity operation x_i \rightarrow x_i' = -x_i (a reflection about the origin).Griffiths, D., (1987). The effect of symmetry on different types of spectra in diatomic molecules are: === Rotational spectrum === In the electric dipole approximation the transition amplitude for emission or absorption of radiation can be shown to be proportional to the vibronic matrix element of the component of the electric dipole operator D along the molecular axis.

C, The complete electromagnetic Hamiltonian of any molecule is dependent on the parity operation, and its eigenvalues can be given the parity symmetry label + or - depending on whether they are even or odd, respectively.
D, The complete electromagnetic Hamiltonian of any molecule is invariant to the parity operation, and its eigenvalues can be given the parity symmetry label + or - depending on whether they are even or odd, respectively.

Passive transport is a type of membrane transport that does not require energy to move substances across cell membranes. Instead of using cellular energy, like active transport, passive transport relies on the second law of thermodynamics to drive the movement of substances across cell membranes. There are two types of passive transport, passive diffusion and facilitated diffusion. Transcellular transport can occur in three different ways active transport, passive transport, and transcytosis. == Active Transport == Main article: Active transport Active transport is the process of moving molecules from an area of low concentrations to an area of high concentration. Simple diffusion and osmosis are both forms of passive transport and require none of the cell's ATP energy. === Example of diffusion: Gas Exchange === A biological example of diffusion is the gas exchange that occurs during respiration within the human body. The four main kinds of passive transport are simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, filtration, and/or osmosis. 

<<Question:>>

<<Options:>>
A, Active transport and passive transport both require energy input from the cell to function.

The uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an angular momentum operator do not commute, for example L_xL_y eq L_yL_x. Like all other properties of a quantum particle, angular momentum is quantized, meaning it can only equal certain discrete values, which correspond to different rotational energy states. Just as there is an uncertainty principle relating position and momentum, there are uncertainty principles for angular momentum. Angular momentum is subject to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, implying that at any time, only one projection (also called ""component"") can be measured with definite precision; the other two then remain uncertain. Heisenberg's uncertainty relation is one of the fundamental results in quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle (also known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle) is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the accuracy with which the values for certain pairs of physical quantities of a particle, such as position, x, and momentum, p, can be predicted from initial conditions. 

<<Question:>>
What is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and how does it relate to angular momentum in quantum mechanics?

<<Options:>>
A, The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the axis of rotation of a quantum particle is undefined, and that quantum particles possess a type of non-orbital angular momentum called ""spin"". This is because angular momentum, like other quantities in quantum mechanics, is expressed as a tensorial operator in relativistic quantum mechanics.
B, The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the total angular momentum of a system of particles is equal to the sum of the individual particle angular momenta, and that the centre of mass is for the system. This is because angular momentum, like other quantities in quantum mechanics, is expressed as an operator with quantized eigenvalues.
C, The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the total angular momentum of a system of particles is subject to quantization, and that the individual particle angular momenta are expressed as operators. This is because angular momentum, like other quantities in quantum mechanics, is subject to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
D, The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the axis of rotation of a quantum particle is undefined, and that at any given time, only one projection of angular momentum can be measured with definite precision, while the other two remain uncertain. This is because angular momentum, like other quantities in quantum mechanics, is subject to quantization and expressed as an operator with quantized eigenvalues.
E, The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that at any given time, only one projection of angular momentum can be measured with definite precision, while the other two remain uncertain.

In broad terms, convection arises because of body forces acting within the fluid, such as gravity. ===Natural convection=== Natural convection is a type of flow, of motion of a liquid such as water or a gas such as air, in which the fluid motion is not generated by any external source (like a pump, fan, suction device, etc.) but by some parts of the fluid being heavier than other parts. * Forced convection: when a fluid is forced to flow over the surface by an internal source such as fans, by stirring, and pumps, creating an artificially induced convection current.http://www.engineersedge.com/heat_transfer/convection.htm Engineers Edge, 2009, ""Convection Heat Transfer"",Accessed 20/04/09 In many real-life applications (e.g. heat losses at solar central receivers or cooling of photovoltaic panels), natural and forced convection occur at the same time (mixed convection). Forced convection is type of heat transport in which fluid motion is generated by an external source like a (pump, fan, suction device, etc.). Forced convection is a mechanism, or type of transport, in which fluid motion is generated by an external source (like a pump, fan, suction device, etc.). In thermodynamics, convection often refers to heat transfer by convection, where the prefixed variant Natural Convection is used to distinguish the fluid mechanics concept of Convection (covered in this article) from convective heat transfer. Forced convection is often encountered by engineers designing or analyzing heat exchangers, pipe flow, and flow over a plate at a different temperature than the stream (the case of a shuttle wing during re-entry, for example).Forced Convection Heat Transfer Bahrami, M Simon Fraser University Sept 2015 ==Mixed convection== In any forced convection situation, some amount of natural convection is always present whenever there are gravitational forces present (i.e., unless the system is in an inertial frame or free-fall). 

<<Question:>>

C, Natural convection occurs when a fluid is in contact with a hot surface, causing the fluid to be less dense and displaced, while forced convection is when a fluid is forced to flow over the surface by an internal source such as fans, stirring, and pumps.
D, Natural convection is when a fluid is forced to flow over the surface by an internal source such as fans, stirring, and pumps, while forced convection occurs when a fluid is in contact with a hot surface, causing the fluid to be less dense and displaced.

Magnetic susceptibility indicates whether a material is attracted into or repelled out of a magnetic field. This allows classical physics to make useful predictions while avoiding the underlying quantum mechanical details. ==Definition== === Volume susceptibility === Magnetic susceptibility is a dimensionless proportionality constant that indicates the degree of magnetization of a material in response to an applied magnetic field. In electromagnetism, the magnetic susceptibility (; denoted , chi) is a measure of how much a material will become magnetized in an applied magnetic field. A closely related property of materials is magnetic susceptibility, which is a dimensionless proportionality factor that indicates the degree of magnetization of a material in response to an applied magnetic field. ==Explanation== In the macroscopic formulation of electromagnetism, there appears two different kinds of magnetic field: * the magnetizing field H which is generated around electric currents and displacement currents, and also emanates from the poles of magnets. Susceptibility may refer to: ==Physics and engineering== In physics the susceptibility is a quantification for the change of an extensive property under variation of an intensive property. This allows an alternative description of all magnetization phenomena in terms of the quantities and , as opposed to the commonly used and . === Molar susceptibility and mass susceptibility === There are two other measures of susceptibility, the molar magnetic susceptibility () with unit m3/mol, and the mass magnetic susceptibility () with unit m3/kg that are defined below, where is the density with unit kg/m3 and is molar mass with unit kg/mol: \begin{align} \chi_\rho &= \frac{\chi_\text{v}}{\rho}; \\\ \chi_\text{m} &= M\chi_\rho = \frac{M}{\rho} \chi_\text{v}. \end{align} === In CGS units === The definitions above are according to the International System of Quantities (ISQ) upon which the SI is based.

A transient condensation cloud, also called a Wilson cloud, is observable surrounding large explosions in humid air. The lifetime of the Wilson cloud during nuclear air bursts can be shortened by the thermal radiation from the fireball, which heats the cloud above to the dew point and evaporates the droplets. ===Non-nuclear explosions=== Any sufficiently large explosion, such as one caused by a large quantity of conventional explosives or a volcanic eruption, can create a condensation cloud, as seen in Operation Sailor Hat or in the 2020 Beirut explosion, where a very large Wilson cloud expanded outwards from the blast. ===Aircraft and Rockets=== The same kind of condensation cloud is sometimes seen above the wings of aircraft in a moist atmosphere. Similar condensation effects can be observed as Wilson clouds, also called condensation clouds, at large explosions in humid air and other Prandtl–Glauert singularity effects. == See also == * Nuclear emulsion – also used to record and investigate fast charged particles * Bubble chamber * Spark chamber * Gilbert U-238 Atomic Energy Laboratory science kit for children (1950–1951) * Contrail == Notes == ==References== * == Gallery == File:Particle Tracks in AWAN Expansion Cloud Chamber.jpg|Particle tracks from radioisotopes in an expansion cloud chamber. Such vapor can also be seen in low pressure regions during high–g subsonic maneuvers of aircraft in humid conditions. ==Occurrence== ===Nuclear weapons testing=== Scientists observing the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in 1946 at Bikini Atoll named that transitory cloud a ""Wilson cloud"" because the same pressure effect is employed in a Wilson cloud chamber to let condensation mark the tracks of electrically- charged sub-atomic particles. Analysts of later nuclear bomb tests used the more general term ""condensation cloud"" in preference to ""Wilson cloud"". The brightness of the glow decreases rapidly with elapsed time since the detonation, becoming only barely visible after a few tens of seconds. ===Condensation effects=== Nuclear mushroom clouds are often accompanied by short-lived vapour clouds, known variously as ""Wilson clouds"", condensation clouds, or vapor rings.

Various natural phenomena influence Earth's atmospheric and oceanic behaviors. One such phenomenon is hurricanes,
which are intense tropical storms characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall. They form over warm ocean waters
and can have a significant impact on weather patterns. The concept of the tropical effect refers to the conditions
associated with high temperatures and humidity in tropical regions but is not directly related to global wind
patterns. Similarly, the muon effect and centrifugal effect have specific scientific contexts but do not play a
primary role in determining the direction of global winds. In contrast, the Coriolis effect is the key factor
responsible for the observed northeast to southwest and northwest to southeast movement of global winds in the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, respectively. This phenomenon is a result of the Earth's rotation and 
significantly influences atmospheric circulation patterns worldwide.

The second equation is more general as it does not require that the weight of each segment be distributed uniformly. thumb|Figure 01-Sample continuous beam section ==Derivation of three moments equations == Mohr's theorem can be used to derive the three moment theorem (TMT). ===Mohr's first theorem=== The change in slope of a deflection curve between two points of a beam is equal to the area of the M/EI diagram between those two points.(Figure 02) thumb|Figure 02-Mohr's First Theorem ===Mohr's second theorem=== Consider two points k1 and k2 on a beam. The deflection of k1 and k2 relative to the point of intersection between tangent at k1 and k2 and vertical through k1 is equal to the moment of M/EI diagram between k1 and k2 about k1.(Figure 03) thumb|Figure03-Mohr's Second Theorem The three moment equation expresses the relation between bending moments at three successive supports of a continuous beam, subject to a loading on a two adjacent span with or without settlement of the supports. ===The sign convention=== According to the Figure 04, # The moment M1, M2, and M3 be positive if they cause compression in the upper part of the beam. (sagging positive) # The deflection downward positive. In civil engineering and structural analysis Clapeyron's theorem of three moments is a relationship among the bending moments at three consecutive supports of a horizontal beam. The concept of bending moment is very important in engineering (particularly in civil and mechanical engineering) and physics. == Background == Tensile and compressive stresses increase proportionally with bending moment, but are also dependent on the second moment of area of the cross-section of a beam (that is, the shape of the cross-section, such as a circle, square or I-beam being common structural shapes). Theorem 2: The displacement of a point in the real beam is numerically equal to the moment at the corresponding point in the conjugate beam. ==Conjugate-beam supports== When drawing the conjugate beam it is important that the shear and moment developed at the supports of the conjugate beam account for the corresponding slope and displacement of the real beam at its supports, a consequence of Theorems 1 and 2. The moment-area theorem is an engineering tool to derive the slope, rotation and deflection of beams and frames.

D, The three moment theorem is used to calculate the weight distribution of each segment of a beam, which is required to apply Mohr's theorem.

A throttle is the mechanism by which fluid flow is managed by constriction or obstruction. Lastly, the refrigerant expands isentropically until its temperature falls to that of the low-temperature source, . ==Coefficient of performance== The merit of a refrigerator or heat pump is given by a parameter called the coefficient of performance (COP). There are some differences in the criteria concerning the working fluids used in heat engines and refrigeration cycles or heat pumps, which are listed below accordingly: ===Common criteria for both heat engines and refrigeration cycles=== # The saturation pressure at the maximum temperature of the cycle should not be excessive. At the start of the thermodynamic cycle the refrigerant enters the compressor as a low pressure and low temperature vapor. The detailed COP of a refrigerator is given by the following equation: :{\rm COP_R} = \frac{ \text{Desired Output}}{ \text{Required Input}} = \frac{ \text{Cooling Effect}}{ \text{Work Input}} = \frac{ Q_L}{ W_\text{net,in} } The COP of a heat pump (sometimes referred to as coefficient of amplification COA) is given by the following equations, where the first law of thermodynamics: W_{net,in}+Q_{L}+Q_{H} = \Delta_{cycle}U = 0 and |Q_{H}|= -Q_{H} was used in one of the last steps: :{\rm COP_{HP} } = \frac{ \text{Desired Output}} { \text{Required Input}} = \frac{ \text{Heating Effect}} { \text{Work Input}} = \frac{|Q_H|} { W_\text{net,in} }= \frac{W_{net,in} + Q_L} { W_\text{net,in} }=1 +\frac { Q_L} { W_\text{net,in} } Both the COP of a refrigerator and a heat pump can be greater than one. Next, the refrigerant is compressed isentropically (adiabatically, without heat transfer) and its temperature rises to that of the high-temperature source, . 

<<Question:>>
What is the throttling process, and why is it important?

<<Options:>>
A, The throttling process is a steady flow of a fluid through a flow resistance, such as a valve or porous plug, and is responsible for the pressure increase in domestic refrigerators. This process is important because it is at the heart of the refrigeration cycle.
B, The throttling process is a steady adiabatic flow of a fluid through a flow resistance, such as a valve or porous plug, and is responsible for the temperature drop in domestic refrigerators. This process is important because it is at the heart of the refrigeration cycle.

When the temperature of the solution is subsequently lowered it briefly becomes supersaturated and then the compound crystallizes out until chemical equilibrium at the lower temperature is achieved. Similarly, when the molten crystal is cooled, the molecules will return to their crystalline form once the temperature falls beyond the turning point. In most cases solubility decreases with decreasing temperature; in such cases the excess of solute will rapidly separate from the solution as crystals or an amorphous powder. As a consequence, during its formation process the crystal is in an environment where the solute concentration reaches a certain critical value, before changing status. This is not a different process, rather a special application of one (or both) of the above. ===Cooling crystallization=== ====Application==== Most chemical compounds, dissolved in most solvents, show the so-called direct solubility that is, the solubility threshold increases with temperature. upright=1.3|thumb|Solubility of the system Na2SO4 – H2O So, whenever the conditions are favorable, crystal formation results from simply cooling the solution.

In more formal terms, Newton's second law of motion states that the force exerted on an object is directly proportional to the acceleration hence acquired by that object, thus: : F = ma, where m represents the mass of the object undergoing an acceleration a. One newton is therefore the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one metre per second squared in the direction of the applied force. A better scientific definition of mass is its description as being a measure of inertia, which is the tendency of an object to not change its current state of motion (to remain at constant velocity) unless acted on by an external unbalanced force. As a result, the newton may be defined in terms of the kilogram (\text{kg}), metre (\text{m}), and second (\text{s}) as : 1\ \text{N} = 1\ \frac{\text{kg}{\cdot}\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}. ==Examples== At average gravity on Earth (conventionally, ), a kilogram mass exerts a force of about 9.8 newtons. The inertial mass, on the other hand, quantifies how much an object accelerates if a given force is applied to it. In scientific contexts, mass is the amount of ""matter"" in an object (though ""matter"" may be difficult to define), but weight is the force exerted on an object's matter by gravity.de Silva, G.M.S. (2002), Basic Metrology for ISO 9000 Certification, Butterworth-Heinemann At the Earth's surface, an object whose mass is exactly one kilogram weighs approximately 9.81 newtons, the product of its mass and the gravitational field strength there. 

<<Question:>>
What is the relationship between mass, force, and acceleration, according to Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?

<<Options:>>
A, Mass is a property that determines the weight of an object. According to Newton's laws of motion and the formula F = ma, an object with a mass of one kilogram accelerates at one meter per second per second when acted upon by a force of one newton.
B, Mass is an inertial property that determines an object's tendency to remain at constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force. According to Newton's laws of motion and the formula F = ma, an object with a mass of one kilogram accelerates at ten meters per second per second when acted upon by a force of one newton.
C, Mass is an inertial property that determines an object's tendency to remain at constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force. According to Newton's laws of motion and the formula F = ma, an object with a mass of one kilogram accelerates at ten meters per second per second when acted upon by a force of ten newtons.
D, Mass is an inertial property that determines an object's tendency to remain at constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force. According to Newton's laws of motion and the formula F = ma, an object with a mass of one kilogram accelerates at one meter per second per second when acted upon by a force of one newton.
E, Mass is a property that determines the size of an object. According to Newton's laws of motion and the formula F = ma, an object with a mass of one kilogram accelerates at one meter per second per second when acted upon by a force of ten newtons.

In 1922, Arthur Eddington showed that two of Einstein's types of waves were artifacts of the coordinate system he used, and could be made to propagate at any speed by choosing appropriate coordinates, leading Eddington to jest that they ""propagate at the speed of thought"". This also cast doubt on the physicality of the third (transverse–transverse) type that Eddington showed always propagate at the speed of light regardless of coordinate system. Eddington's criticism seems to have been based partly on a suspicion that a purely mathematical derivation from relativity theory was not enough to explain the seemingly daunting physical paradoxes that were inherent to degenerate stars, but to have ""raised irrelevant objections"" in addition, as Thanu Padmanabhan puts it. ==Relativity== During World War I, Eddington was secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society, which meant he was the first to receive a series of letters and papers from Willem de Sitter regarding Einstein's theory of general relativity. (This was the coordinate time and metric that both Eddington and Finkelstein presented in their papers.) On 3 June, despite the clouds that had reduced the quality of the plates, Eddington recorded in his notebook: ""... one plate I measured gave a result agreeing with Einstein."" It contained the following quatrain: During the 1920s and 30s, Eddington gave numerous lectures, interviews, and radio broadcasts on relativity, in addition to his textbook The Mathematical Theory of Relativity, and later, quantum mechanics.
